# Probe Index — PS5 14.10
| 271a | `ioctl_catalog_matrix` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **13.60-derived ioctl codes.** Tries 57 capstone-verified command codes (groups A/B/D/f/H/O/P/S/t/U from `docs/IOCTL_CATALOG_13_60.md`) on 10 openable /dev nodes; records every return != -1. Companion to PR #74. |
| 272a | `sys532_survey` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Syscall 532 (13.60: real, narg 5).** Tries accepted types {1-7,31,0x18-0x1E,0x20,0x2f} with id 0 + id sweep; three zeroed 0x100 buffers; records writes. Closes PR #72's 530-532/537 gap together with `docs/SYSCALL_532_13_60_ANALYSIS.md` (528-531/537 = nosys on 13.60). |
| 273a | `umtx_waiter_vs_remap` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Waiter-vs-vm race.** Child thread blocks in 454/op5 on a locked umtx word; main replaces the page via mmap MAP_FIXED and unlocks; munmap control. Panics = kernel bug. Op map from `docs/UMTX_OPS_13_60.md`. |
| 274a | `cs_ss_discrimination` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **set_mcontext copy map discrimination.** A: CS=0x00 + SS=0x3B + valid RIP/RSP (copy map predicts LIVE); B: CS=0x43 + SS=0x00 (predicts panic; run last). Decides the corrected PR #30/#31 narrative (`docs/THR_CREATE_SETMCONTEXT_COPYMAP_13_60.md`). |
| 275a | `sysent_tail_realargs` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **677+ real-args discrimination.** 13.60 CSV resolves 53 real handlers in 677-734; probe calls fault-proof members (705/713/733/687/690) with real args. Return = table extends; kill on 705 = strongest table-end signal. |
| 275b | `virtual_query_by_pid` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Syscall 728 real args** (13.60 shape: pid, addr, flags-0x20000-mandatory, outbuf, count; sandbox+cred gates). Per-pid VM query attempt with self pid, pid=0, and flag variants. |
| 276a | `aio_lifecycle` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Relapse surface recheck.** 13.60-decoded shapes: 669 submit_cmd (cmd&0xFFF in {1,2}, size>=0x81, type in {1,2,3}), 663 wait (ids,count,states,mode,timeout), 670 init. Tests whether submission is accepted on 14.10 (`docs/AIO_FAMILY_13_60_DECODE.md`). |
| 277a | `mmap2_realargs` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Syscall 725 real args.** 13.60: 6-arg mmap variant with extended flags + special bit 0x200000 and proc+0xc81 gate. Tests W^X policy (prot RX/RWX/X) through the never-measured second mapping entry point. |
| 278a | `cclosure_control_return` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **56d ladder step.** Redirect rawequal +0x20 to plain `ret` (garbage result count -> stale Lua stack slots readback), `xor eax,eax;ret` (completes 54p), `pop rdi;ret` last (likely kill). 56c's parser + restore discipline. |

Probe inventory with status and key result. Entries marked PREPARED lack a recorded run here; statuses are curated interpretations, not automatic verdicts. The offline auditor matches each ID separately against exact names or explicit terminal-`*` prefixes; ambiguous group rows require individual mappings. See [the ledger guide](RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.md).

The [2026-10-19 live test session](LIVE_TEST_SESSION_2026-10-19.md) contains 51 additional attempted runs, including probes still marked PREPARED in this older index. Use that session log and its per-run captures for current status until this inventory is reconciled.

| 10 | `umtx_stress` | OK | "umtx" operations — actually called syscall 557 (namedobj_create), not `_umtx_op(454)`; see [UMTX_454_EVIDENCE](UMTX_454_EVIDENCE.md) |
| 11 | `umtx_race` | PARTIAL | Race condition attempts (no threading = no races); also called 557, not 454 |
| 12 | `nwake_robust` | OK | nwake/robust behavior mapping — via syscall 557, not 454 |
| 13 | `nwake_oracle` | OK | nwake as kernel state oracle — via syscall 557, not 454 |
| 14 | `device_ioctl` | OK | Device ioctl — all blocked by sandbox |
| 15 | `dmem_deep` | OK | Direct memory device deep dive |
| 16 | `dmem_mmap` | CRASH | dmem mmap attempts — crashed |
| 17 | `dmem_kptr` | OK | Searched for kernel pointers in dmem |
| 18 | `dmem_phys` | OK | Physical memory mapping attempts |
| 19 | `aio_stress` | CRASH | Historical probe summary says AIO stress caused loader crashes; consult raw logs before generalizing to every AIO entry |
| 19b | `aio_safe` | OK | Historical summary says tested AIO calls were blocked; exact tested calls/arguments are not captured in this table |
| 19c–g | `aio_*` | VARIOUS | Progressive AIO checks; scope is limited to calls/arguments in their raw records |
| 20 | `kqueue_stress` | OK | Read filters and timer filters registered; events observed; close/delete churn completed |
| 21 | `kqueue_deep` | OK | Signal/user filters registered; 2,000 knotes registered/deleted; no copy-on-fork test |
| 22 | `signal_stress` | OK | Signal handler installation works, SIG_IGN/SIG_DFL ok |
| 23 | `sigalt_exploit` | KILLED | sigaltstack + signal delivery → EFAULT, process killed |
| 24 | `sigalt_kwrite` | KILLED | Kernel write via sigaltstack — copyout() validates dest |
| 25 | `sigalt_safe` | OK | Safe sigaltstack — confirmed completely dead |
| 25b | `sigalt_ign` | OK | SIG_IGN behavior with altstack |
| 25c | `sigprocmask` | OK | **sigprocmask is a no-op** — returns 0, does nothing |
| 26 | `gadget_scan` | CRASH | Code page read → SIGBUS (XOM) |
| 26b | `ret_gadget` | CRASH | RET gadget search — XOM blocks all reads |
| 26c | `wxor_gadget` | OK | Confirmed W^X: mprotect(EXEC) always fails |
| 26d | `find_ret` | CRASH | Another code read attempt — XOM |
| 26e | `code_read` | OK | **Execute-only memory confirmed** — cannot read code pages |
| 26f | `kstack_crash` | CRASH | Kernel stack probe via crash handler |
| 27 | `thread_and_fd` | OK | **Threading fully blocked** — fork/rfork/thr_new all -1. dup/dup2 blocked. fstat blocked. |
| 28 | `ipv6_scmrights` | OK | SCM_RIGHTS works, IPv6 ext headers blocked on send |
| 29 | `rthdr_mmap` | INCOMPLETE | Last readable output: UAF test page address in PART 2, followed by a binary tail. No later call result or termination cause is established. |
| 30 | `mmap_fcntl_deep` | INCOMPLETE | Saved output ends at `mlock: rv=0`; no msync/minherit result or termination cause is recorded. |
| 30b | `fcntl_scm` | OK | **writev works** (IOV_MAX=1024), **SCM_RIGHTS validated** (5/5 correct), F_SETFL returns -1 but changes flags, pipe2 blocked |
| 30c | `fcntl_bypass` | OK | **F_SETFL is cosmetic only** — flags appear set but kernel ignores them. F_SETOWN truly blocked. poll() works. kqueue fd allocation also confirmed; see probe 20 for kevent results. |
| 31 | `sockopt_fuzz` | OK | TCP_INFO 236 bytes (no pointers), TCP_CONGESTION="newreno", IP_TTL accepts 256/-1, SO_SNDBUF/RCVBUF accept 1 |
| 31b | `tcpinfo_dump` | OK | Full TCP_INFO hex dump — all protocol metadata, **no kernel pointer leaks**. 23 SOL_SOCKET options accessible. IP_HDRINCL=8 is INP_HDRINCL flag. |
| 31c | `ps5opts_fuzz` | OK | **PS5 custom socket options** (0x2000–0x100000) are boolean flag bits in so_options. Not exploitable. |
| 32 | `bufstress` | HANG | SNDBUF=1 write blocked (F_SETFL nonblock is fake) |
| 32b | `bufstress` | HANG | Same issue — F_SETFL doesn't actually work |
| 32c | `safe_stress` | OK | SETFIB/USER_COOKIE/TS_CLOCK readable but sets blocked. **poll() works perfectly.** SO_TIMESTAMP accepted but no cmsg on UNIX. |
| 32d | `minimal` | RESET | Loader bad state after crashes |
| 32e | `ping` | OK | Minimal ping — loader alive |
| 33a | `sndbuf_step1` | OK | SNDBUF=1 + single write(1) = success (rv=1) |
| 33b | `sndbuf_step2` | HANG | Second write on full SNDBUF=1 buffer blocks (nonblock fake) |
| 33c | `nonblock_test` | HANG | O_NONBLOCK confirmed fake — read blocks on empty socket |
| 33d | `sock_nonblock` | CRASH | SOCK_NONBLOCK (0x20000000) crashes socketpair |
| 33e | `dontwait` | CRASH | **sendto(133)/recvfrom(29) crash syscall.resolve()** |
| 33f | `dontwait_safe` | OK | **MSG_DONTWAIT (0x80) is the real nonblocking mechanism.** recv(empty)=EAGAIN, send works, SNDBUF=1 partial writes correct, 100x rapid cycling clean. |
| 34 | `raw_hdrincl` | OK | **RAW socket + IP_HDRINCL WORKS.** Crafted UDP packet reached listener through kernel ip_input(). TCP SYN dropped (bad checksum). bind/connect on raw socket work. |
| 35 | `frag_fuzz` | FAIL | All 10 fragment tests: no data arrived. Root cause: **listener bind failed** (not fragment-related). |
| 35b | `frag_isolate` | FAIL | Confirmed: bind() returning -1 is the root cause. Even unfragmented UDP fails when bind fails. Need to investigate port restrictions. |
| 36 | `bind_port_sweep` | OK | **Port policy mapped: <1024 and ≥40000 blocked; 1024–32767 bind fine.** Solves the 35/35b bind mystery. |
| 37 | `ip_options` | OK | RR/TS/NOP pass; malformed lens rejected at ip_output (never reach parser); **LSRR/SSRR/TS-overflow sent but dropped on input** — option processing confirmed, need real-network delivery for input-side fuzz. |
| 38 | `untested_syscalls` | INCOMPLETE | **ktimer_create/settime WORK** (timers are live kernel objects!), memfd stub, getrandom/ppoll/cap_rights blocked. Output ends at the isolated minherit section header, before any minherit result. Termination and its cause are unresolved. |
| 39 | `frag_reass` | OK | **ip_reass fully correct on all 7 cases** (baseline, OOO, overlap, tiny-first, dup-final, 9-frag, proto-47). No crash. Deeper fuzz (timeouts, queue limits) still open. |
| 40 | `tcp_connectback` | OK | **TCP connect-back fuzz works.** Fake-IP ARP responder (`run_session40.py`) defeats host-OS RST interference. Full handshake + 26 malformed segments delivered (SACK/URG/seq-overlap/all-flags/RST+data); console stable. |
| 41c | `safe_adjacent` | OK | GPU mmap adjacency confirmed: 256+ adjacent pages accessible without guard pages |
| 41d | `heap_dump` | OK | Heap dump through GPU boundary, analyzed layout |
| 41e | `write_test` | OK | Heap write verified: read/write/restore clean |
| 41f–l | `heap_objects`/`uaf_spray` | OK | Explored heap spraying and object allocation |
| 41m | `vtable_probe` | CRASH | 0x1A3A4EE0 is **unmapped** (SIGSEGV). Crash record format decoded: magic 0x13371337, leaks module code base + heap regs = **ASLR oracle**. |
| 41n–41q | `header_chase*` | OK | Full heap scans (entire mapped heap + anchor-relative windows): **zero 0x1A3A4EE0 objects in fresh sessions** — 41k-era hits were spray artifacts. Dead end documented. |
| 41o | `heap_infoleak` | OK | `dynlib_get_info` ASLR bypass: leaks all 39 loaded module bases |
| 41r–t | `eboot_gadgets` | OK | Full ROP gadget catalog extracted from RX eboot segment |
| 41u–v | `got_dump`/`syscall_ret` | OK | Syscall return mechanisms mapped |
| 41w | `kernel_rw` | OK | Mapped eboot gadgets, confirmed sysctl works via make_syscall |
| 41z | chain_hijack | OK | Chain, fn_addr, and argument slots are writable heap data; probe 45c later recorded tested syscall results persisting after specific metadata mutations, so an execution role is not established. |
| 42a | `ktimer_deep` | OK | Clocks 0+4 usable; **validation correct** (nsec>1e9/-1/2^63 rejected); gettime/delete blocked while settime works (odd split); cap=27 timers. |
| 42b | `memfd_msync` | INCOMPLETE | memfd_create returned fd=1; output ends after the msync section prints `region @ 0x31139cee0`. No msync result or termination record; cause unresolved. |
| 42c | `kaslr_deep` | OK | Dense kinfo_proc and fstat dumps confirm sentinels (0xFFFFFFFF_*); /dev/dmem0 and /dev/hid open at fd=24 |
| 42d | `dmem_kaslr` | OK | /dev/dmem0 ioctls/allocations fail; proc.filedesc and kstack blocked |
| 42e | `sysctl_enum` | OK | MIB tree walking: non-leaf node queries blocked by sandbox |
| 42f | `ps5_syscall_scan` | OK | Probed 576–619: mtypeprotect(585) ret=1, getCpuUsage(617) ret=0; memory queries fail |
| 42f2 | `fast_phys_scan` | OK | Scanned 90 physical offsets: only phys 0 is non-zero |
| 42g | `fnaddr_dump` | OK | Dumped fn_addr target code across multiple module bases |
| 42g2 | `high_phys_decode` | INCOMPLETE | Saved output ends at the STEP 1 kenv header (88 B); no call result or kill record is present. |
| 42g3 | `high_phys_only` | OK | 4GB+ physical address scan: all zeros (no CPU DRAM accessible via dmem0) |
| 42g4 | `minimal_high` | OK | Physical scan of 4GB, 4.5GB, and PS5 hardware ranges: confirms dmem0 is GPU-only |
| 42h | `code_dump` | OK | Code dump of fn_addr target |
| 42h2 | `rop_exploit2` | OK | Identified and mapped 13 argument slots in active ROP chain; sysctl proc.all/file blocked |
| 42i | `vmquery` | OK | virtualQuery/jitCreateShared blocked; mincore works (vec=0x1F); dumped 39 module text ranges |
| 42j | `thread_ptrace` | OK | thr_self works (TID=101819); procctl blocked; libkernel data scanned (no kptrs) |
| 43a | `kldstat_kaslr` | INCOMPLETE | Header-only 145 B log; no syscall result, error, or kill record. Retest 53c prepared. |
| 43b | `kldsym_resolve` | INCOMPLETE | Header-only 116 B log; no syscall result, error, or kill record. Retest 53c prepared. |
| 43c | `sysarch_gsbase` | OK | GET_GSBASE=0 (no kernel ptr). GET_FSBASE=userland TCB. GET_XFPUSTATE=ret 0. |
| 43d | `kinfo_proc_full` | OK | Full 1096B dump: only `0xFFFFFFFF_00000000` at +0x60 (sentinel). Process="boot.bin". FILEDESC blocked. VMMAP ret=-1. |
| 43e | `blocked_syscall_bypass` | PARTIAL | **fstat works** via make_syscall (no kptrs). ioctl=-1 even raw. dup/dup2=-1. **thr_new crashed** (still blocked). |
| 43f | `sysctl_write` | OK | One securelevel-labeled write returned -1. coredump/debug/maxproc reads returned -1; their conditional writes were not reached. somaxconn read returned 0/value 1024; no write test. MIB identities remain probe annotations. |
| 43g | `sony_syscall_sweep` | KILLED | **Syscall 557 returns 16901** (live Sony syscall!). Syscall 620 ret=0. Process killed mid-sweep. |
| 43h | `mtypeprotect_wxbypass` | OK | mtypeprotect returns 1 for ALL prot values (RWX, RX, X). Page still RW after call. mprotect(RX) still -1. **Execution not tested.** |
| 43i | fn_redirect | HISTORICAL CLAIM NOT ESTABLISHED | The run recorded writable fn_addr/slot0; source restores slot0 before getpid, so modified-slot persistence across that call was not tested. Probe 45c recorded tested syscall results persisting after selected mutations. No arbitrary function-call primitive is established, and the dispatch path remains unknown. |
| 43j | `msgbuf_full_read` | OK | kern.msgbuf returns only 8 bytes (stub/filtered). boottime=0x6AD29A84. features=null UUID. No kptrs. |
| 43k | `cpuusage_deep` | KILLED | CpuUsage returns 0 with empty buffers (0-15 CPUs). mtypeprotect(585) consistently ret=1. Crashed during exec test. Syscall 620 alive. |
| 43l | `mincore_kaslr` | OK | mincore works on userland only. **All kernel VA probes return -1.** No KASLR oracle. 32GB (0x800000000) is mapped. |
| 43m | `sockopt_overflow` | OK | setsockopt accepts up to 4KB buffers but getsockopt returns correct 4B. Kernel clamps copy length. **Not an overflow.** |
| 43n | `hid_ioctl` | OK | /dev/hid opens (fd=23). All ioctls return Sony error 0x80740004. FIONREAD=0. /dev/null,zero,urandom open. /dev/bpf,crypto,pf blocked. |
| 43o | `afroute_kaslr` | INCONCLUSIVE | Socket opens, but the RTM_GET write returns -1; the read returned 108 bytes with zero detected pointers and unresolved attribution. No leak was validly tested and patch status is unknown. Retest 53b prepared. |
| 43p | `aio_bypass` | INCOMPLETE | Saved output stops immediately before the first standard AIO call, aio_error(317). Its result and the planned Sony syscall scan (including 663) are unknown. |
| 44a | `mtypeprotect_exec` | EXECUTION NOT ESTABLISHED | NOP success banner required only pcall survival; requested 0x41414141 instead returned PID 121. Neither execute permission nor W^X bypass is established. See 45c controls. |
| 44b | `sony557_deep` | OK | Syscall 557 returns 0x4205 only with buffer arg. Process type/sandbox query. No data in buffer. |
| 44c | `sockopt_heap_corrupt` | OK | No heap corruption. Kernel clamps copy to option size. 40 sprayed sockets unaffected. Not exploitable. |
| 44d | `kaslr_creative` | OK | NET_RT_IFLISTL returns 6.5KB (no kptrs). kern.usrstack=0x7EF5A8000. Signal handler=0x511FD8F4. All other paths blocked. |
| 45a | `native_exec_kaslr` | SIDE EFFECT NOT ESTABLISHED | actual_len=2048 equals its initialization 0x800; result slot retained its sentinel. No native sysctl side effect is demonstrated. |
| 45b | shellcode_write_diag | NO EXECUTION EVIDENCE | Tested return values stayed equal to the process ID and proposed shellcode writes did not land. These observations do not establish execution; probe 45c later showed tested calls persisting after metadata mutations. |
| 45c | `execution_reality_check` | EARLIER MODEL CONTRADICTED FOR TESTED CALLS | Completed 192713 run records sysctl/getpid results after selected fn_addr changes and chain corruption. Earlier 192602 stops in section B and must remain separate. Full dispatch implementation is unknown; earlier fn_addr execution/W^X claims are unsupported. |
| 46a | `sony_syscall_deep` | PARTIAL | Run 1 hit Lua 5.1's unsupported `%b` format option. Run 2 reached Section F and truncated during the 550–625 sweep; the ending call is unknown. Per-call markers and a sweep completion count are now added for a rerun. |
| 46b | loader_dispatch | PARTIAL | The log reports syscall objects sharing a metatable and a C-function __call at 0x311023aa0; it truncates at Section D. The function implementation and its relationship to the ROP-shaped metadata were not established. |
| 46d | `socket_bypass` | PARTIAL | **socketpair works via make_syscall** (ret=0). Socket creation identical between paths. SCTP still -1. TCP connect-back timed out (no server). |
| 47a | `dispatch_deep` | PARTIAL | **Section C (CClosure write test) SKIPPED** — address parse bug (no 0x prefix). 557 version sweep: ver=0 returned 16901; tested positive versions followed 517+ver. No buffer modification. socketpair SCM_RIGHTS: cmsg zeros. LOCAL_PEERCRED: uid=1,gid=1. |
| 47b | `cclosure_hijack` | INCONCLUSIVE | Write loop covered offsets {16,24,32,40,48}; it did not test +0. The log conflicts about the +0 candidate and +16 result. Retest 53d prepared; no control-flow conclusion is established. |
| 48a | `sctp_ipv6_icmp` | OK | **★★ MASSIVE: SCTP raw socket OPEN (fd=22), IPv6 fully available (TCP/UDP/RAW/ICMPv6), 143 raw IPv4 protocols, 17 IPv6 raw protocols.** New kernel attack surface discovered. |
| 46c | `ip_options_listener` | PARTIAL | UDP listener + RAW socket on port 31338, IP_RECVOPTS set. **0 packets received** — PC-side injector not running. Needs coordinated PC+PS5 execution. |
| 48b | `sctp_loopback_fuzz` | OK | 39 SCTP chunk variants to loopback via raw IP+IP_HDRINCL. Send results and COMPLETE are recorded; input-handler processing is not independently established. INIT len=0/1/0xFFFF, SACK maxgaps, COOKIE garbage, 50 ABORTs, FWD_TSN — all survived. Deeper state-based attacks needed. |
| 48c | `ipv6_exthdr_fuzz` | OK | 83 IPv6 extension header variants to ::1. **No crashes, 0 send errors.** HBH overrun, RH Type 0 CVE, frag overlap/bomb, dest opts, 16-deep chain nesting, ICMPv6 option len=0, payload len mismatch — the log reaches COMPLETE. This does not establish complete handler coverage or general parser hardening. |
| 49a | `tcp_inject_loopback` | OK | **★★ TCP_INFO leaks SND_NXT (+108) and RCV_NXT (+112).** 182 injected TCP segments via raw IP to loopback ESTABLISHED connection. RST left the observed state ESTABLISHED; the log does not establish challenge ACK behavior. SACK, PAWS, option parser (len=0/255), URG, zero-window, FIN-data, ACK storm, SYN flood — **COMPLETE recorded**; complete handler coverage and RFC compliance are not established. Port fix: 31337 (original 44444 was ≥40000 blocked). |
| 49b | `ipv6_frag_reassembly` | OK | 280 IPv6 fragments across 12 attack categories targeting ip6_reass(). Teardrop, queue exhaustion (50 incomplete + 101-frag bomb), huge totals (65535/65592/65784), atomic frags, interleaved IDs (10 reverse-complete), ext hdr combos (HBH/RH/DO+frag, nested frag-in-frag), ICMPv6 frags — **COMPLETE recorded**; reassembly coverage and RFC 5722 compliance are not established. |
| 50a | `exotic_protocols` | OK | 86 packets across IGMP/GRE/ESP/AH/PIM/OSPF/VRRP + batch sweeps. **COMPLETE recorded.** This does not establish which protocol handler paths processed the packets or general robustness. |
| 50b | `timer_manipulation` | PARTIAL | Section A (keepalive) completed: TCP_KEEPIDLE/INTVL/CNT all blocked (ret=-1). SO_KEEPALIVE works. Write-after-peer-close ok. **Timed out after Section A** — later sections (linger, timeouts, buffer resize) not reached. |
| 50c | `resource_exhaustion` | PARTIAL | FD limit hit at 63 connections (sandbox cap). Backlog flood timed out (blocked on connect). Sections B-H not reached. |
| 50d | `cross_protocol_tunnel` | CRASH | **★ Consistently kills the loader.** 0 bytes, all subsequent probes fail until PS5 restart. Persistent loader corruption — not just per-connection crash. Needs debug. |
| 50e | `ipv6_msfilter_reach` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Single-threaded MSFILTER reachability for CVE-2026-49412 (does not attempt the race): join ff02::1, setsockopt(41, 74) with 0/1 sources, malformed registry, getsockopt readback, v4 parity. Validated offline only (Lua compile + stub-loader execution). See [the assessment](CVE-2026-49412-PS5-14.10.md). |
| 51a | `sony_syscall_survey` | PARTIAL | Tested ~55 of 110 Sony syscalls (532-676). **7 accessible: 596, 572, 624 (ret=3377!), 563-566.** Output truncated before completing range. No crashes. |
| 51b | `accessible_syscall_deep` | OK | Tested 30 call patterns. 585, 606, 643, and 640 return non-error results for supplied arguments; output buffers contain no observed kernel pointers. 624 differs by one from 51a; two samples do not establish a counter or side channel. See [cross-firmware pattern research](CROSS_FIRMWARE_PATTERN_RESEARCH.md). |
| 51c | `sony_survey_part2` | PARTIAL | Saved output records only 625 and 626 (both -1). The raw log does not show syscall 661 being called, so no kill boundary or result for 661 is established. |
| 52a | survey_627_676 | CRASH | 627-630 all PCALL-FAIL, **sys 631 killed the process**. Only 5 syscalls tested before crash. (2026-10-18) |
| 52b | 624_oracle | OK | **★★ sys 624 = VM operation counter.** +5 per mmap (size-independent), does not decrement on munmap. Zero jitter across 100 samples. Unaffected by sockets/kqueue/memory.alloc. Monotonic budget meter. (2026-10-18) |
| 53a | `aio_retest` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Resumable per-call AIO matrix; records return values and Lua errors separately. |
| 53b | `afroute_retest` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Rebuilds RTM_GET with three header sizes; rejects request echoes and reports failed writes as undelivered. |
| 53c | `kldstat_retest` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Tests syscall candidates 308/367 and kldsym 337 with before/after markers and bounded output inspection. |
| 53d | `cclosure_retest` | OK | Qword offsets 0/8/16/24/32/40/48 were writable and restored successfully. +0x30 was observed holding an eboot-range pointer; the dispatch-consumed field and any control-flow effect remain unresolved. |
| 54a | `dsp_access_check` | OK | Two console runs; `/dev/null` positive control opened and closed, while `/dev/dsp`, `/dev/dsp0.0`, and `/dev/sndstat` returned all-ones failure values. No errno; absence vs denial unresolved. No mmap/ioctl/overflow test. See [CVE-2026-45258 PS5 assessment](CVE-2026-45258-PS5-14.10.md). |
| 54o | `cfunc_redirect_controlled` | INCOMPLETE | Capture stops after the `type()` C-function field write, before the redirected call returns. No post-call value, restore marker, or execution conclusion. See `results/54o_cfunc_redirect_controlled_20261018_092721.txt`. |
| 54p | `redirect_minimal` | INCOMPLETE | Clean no-watchdog retest at 09:43:26 reached the gadget address, then idled after 394 bytes; it did not reach the `write ok` marker or the redirected call. Earlier runs reset or idled before output. No execution conclusion. See the timestamped captures under `results/phase14_final_push/`. |
| 54q | `cfunc_redirect_return1` | INCOMPLETE | After a clean restart, the one-result C-function redirect reached `[B] Alternate pointer write BEFORE` and idled at 09:45:51 before the post-write marker. This isolates the current boundary to the attempted `+0x20` change; no redirected call or native-execution conclusion was recorded. |
| 54r | `cfunc_code_bytes` | OK | Target bytes for seven functions are consistent with x86-64 prologues in the reported eboot RX range. Bytes and the 55g write boundary alone do not prove dispatch; later 56c provides returned-effect evidence for selected targets. (2026-10-18) |
| 55g | `cclosure_write_diagnostic` | INCOMPLETE | Capture changes to binary output after the +0x20 write marker; this alone does not identify an executed instruction or termination cause. Later 56c returned discriminating outputs for selected +0x20 target changes. The full loader layout and internal calls remain inferred. (2026-10-18) |
| 56c | `redirect_nonvm` | OK | Recorded rawequal→rawget, rawget→type, select→tostring and rawequal→tostring output plus restore checks. A/B give discriminating values; C/D print stringified 42 without recording return type. The identical 111606/111610 captures are not independent replications. Internal use of type() is inferred; arbitrary targets/ABI and ROP chaining are not established. (2026-10-18) |
| 54a2 | `rdmsr_precise` | OK | cmd=1 returns -1 for all 16 PMC indices; cmd=4 ret=0 but output all zeros. WRMSR (cmd=2) -1. No MSR data accessible. (2026-10-18) |
| 54b | `jail_bypass` | OK | All 629 arg patterns return -1; kld* retests crash. No jail fast path. Caveat: Phase 2 labels 430 "thr_new" but 430 is `thr_create` (455 is `thr_new`); the row's -1 is a NULL-context shape failure, not threading evidence. See [the 430 note](SYSCALL_430_MISLABEL.md).

| 58e | `thr_create_ucontext` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | First 430 (`thr_create`) call with a readable context: null baseline, zeroed context, an id-pointer oracle that fires before the context checks, then the three validated fields. 13.60 decode in [the note](THR_CREATE_430_CONTEXT.md). |
| 58f | `kevent_timeout_matrix` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Fills the missing cell of the kevent 2x2: split-vs-combined x zero-vs-100ms timeout, fresh kqueue and pipe per cell, plus a zero-timeout recovery poll after the 100ms call. |
| 57e | `kldsym_hardened` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Hardened kldsym(337) probe with pre-flight review. (Merged upstream via PR #13) |
| 58d | `shm_sendfile_reachability` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **CVE-2026-49427/49428 reachability.** Tests shm_open via make_syscall (loader crash bypass?), sendfile, fspacectl, SHM_LARGEPAGE support. |

First revision bound syscall 557 by mistake; corrected with probe 110a. See [UMTX_454_EVIDENCE](UMTX_454_EVIDENCE.md). |
| 109a | `kernel_infoleak_sweep` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | Kernel info leak sweep: fstat on pseudo-fds (kqueue/socket/socketpair), getsockopt 30-option sweep (LOCAL_PEERCRED, SO_PEERLABEL, etc.), sockaddr_un padding scan, kevent event data deep scan (EVFILT_USER/TIMER/PROC/READ). |

CRASH_CLASS: LOW. |
| 111a | `heap_feng_shui` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Kernel heap feng shui via sys 557/558 + sys 624 VM oracle.** Mass handle creation (200), deletion patterns (sequential/random/every-other), cross-type allocation in freed slots (kqueue+socketpair), sys 624 oracle calibration (per-op counter delta), double-free test + handle recycling. |
| 112a | `sys605_gpu_rw_flag_or` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **sys 605 GPU Page R/W + Process Flag OR — CRITICAL, NEVER TESTED.** Arg sweep 0-255+specials, proc flag comparison with sys 643, GPU mmap address as arg, device ID probing (crypto processor 0x3cc80700), struct-based control with output buffer. |
| 113a | `untested_handler_trio` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **sys 615/559/636 — three ZERO-probe handlers.** sys 559 arg=-1 free query (proc+0x5c0), sys 615 VM introspection self-process (9 arg layouts), sys 636 table lookup read path (struct-based + return value classification), cross-reference info leaks with sys 624/606. |
| 114a | `gpu_mmap_alias_race` | OK | GPU mmap aliasing: ten regions are adjacent with no guard page; `MAP_FIXED` inside a live GPU region replaces it, the replaced pages read back zero and neighbours keep their sentinels. Recorded in [ATTACK_SURFACE](ATTACK_SURFACE.md). |
| 93a | `gpu_vm_range_ops` | PARTIAL | sys 654/655/657 on a live GPU mapping: 654 is `-1` for operations 0, 3 and 10-15, 655 is `-1`, 657 is `-1` with `processed=0` for opcodes 1-5; pages stay RW. Recorded in [ATTACK_SURFACE](ATTACK_SURFACE.md). |
| 98a | `gpu_pte_wxbypass` | PARTIAL | sys 547 returns the region record (start, end, packed protection word: `0x33` GPU, `3` heap); sys 653 returned `22`/`23`/`640` once and `-1` ever after, and changes no protection. Recorded in [ATTACK_SURFACE](ATTACK_SURFACE.md). |
| 99a | `hw_write_vm_selfmod` | OK | sys 617 returns `0` for every byte 0x00-0xFF and wide arguments; sys 620 returns `0` once and five times in a row; the VM counter (624) never moves. Recorded in [ATTACK_SURFACE](ATTACK_SURFACE.md). |
| 115a | `flag_or_priv_bypass` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **sys 643 flag OR → privilege bypass chain.** Baseline then post-flag-OR tests of priv-gated syscalls (559/603/636/625), per-bit isolation (32 individual bits vs 559 gate), sys 605+643 combined flag OR, kldstat(308)/kldsym(337) after flag OR, sys 625 MSR read/write after flag OR. Tests whether proc+0xa34 flag bits control priv_check gates. |
| 116a | `umtx_pi_gpu_mmap` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **UMTX PI mutex on GPU mmap pages — kernel casuword() to GPU memory.** TRYLOCK/LOCK/UNLOCK on GPU-backed mutex (kernel writes m_owner via casuword), SET_CEILING on GPU pages, fake owner→unlock PI chain confusion, contested bit corruption, mass lock-corrupt-unlock cycle, post-PI kernel pointer scan. Tests kernel write to GPU-backed VA. |
| 117a | `gadget_redirect_clean` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Clean CClosure gadget redirect verification.** Isolates xor eax,eax;ret (eboot+0x471) as FIRST test (56d garbled output by testing dangerous ret gadget first). 5-round verification on rawequal, cross-validation on rawget. Section B: mov eax,1;ret scan + bare ret. Section C: pop rdi/rsi/rax;ret stack layout probes. Section D: CClosure struct dump + varying arg count tests. Decisive test for arbitrary gadget execution. |
| 118a | `eboot_syscall_scanner` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Eboot syscall instruction discovery.** Scans entire eboot .text for 0F 05 (syscall) and CD 80 (int 0x80) instructions. Dumps ±32 bytes around each for pattern analysis (mov eax,N;syscall, syscall;ret). Locates the loader's dispatch function via fn_addr/ropchain addresses. Maps the path from CClosure redirect to arbitrary kernel syscall. |
| 119a | `evfilt_proc_leak` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **EVFILT_PROC kernel info leak via kevent.** kevent works (probes 20/21) but EVFILT_PROC was NEVER tested. Registers EVFILT_PROC on own PID with NOTE_EXIT/FORK/EXEC/TRACK, polls event data for kernel pointers. Cross-tests EVFILT_PROCDESC/FS/USER. EVFILT_USER trigger+readback analysis. Older FreeBSD leaked kn_data/kn_fflags with kernel addresses. |
| 120a | `pdfork_capsicum` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **pdfork(518) + capsicum via make_syscall.** Probe 02 tested pdfork at WRONG number 475 (via resolve). Real FreeBSD pdfork=518, pdgetpid=519, pdkill=520, pdwait4=521. Goes through different code path than fork — may bypass fork block. Also tests pipe2(542) via make_syscall (only tested via resolve = -1), cap_enter(516), cap_getmode(517). |
| 121a | `procctl_comprehensive` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **procctl(544) comprehensive via make_syscall.** Only tested via resolve (blocked). Tests all status commands (ASLR/trace/stackgap/protmax/wxmap), PROC_ASLR_CTL with FORCE_DISABLE (could disable ASLR!), PROC_WXMAP_CTL with WX_MAPPINGS_PERMIT (could bypass W^X!), PROC_REAP_ACQUIRE, Sony-specific commands 23-50, kernel pointer scan in all output buffers. |
| 76c | `thr_create_safe_longjmp` | OK | thr_create(430) with longjmp-based entry: rv=0, real TID allocated, post-canary clean. Thread created but panics kernel (CS=0 in context). (2026-10-19) |
| 76d | `thr_create_exit_only` | OK | thr_create(430) with thr_exit entry: rv=0, real TID, canary clean. Confirms thread creation itself succeeds. (2026-10-19) |

| 78a | `thr_suspend_race` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **GOLD: thr_suspend(442) race against panicking thread.** Freeze child thread before CS=0 fault triggers panic. If suspend wins: live kernel thread under control. |
| 78b | `thr_heap_spray` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **Kernel heap spray via rapid thr_create.** Multiple threads to fill slab cache with controlled struct thread objects. |
| 78c | `controlled_rsp_trapframe` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | **GOLD: sendsig() RSP→GPU mmap.** Set child thread RSP to GPU pages; kernel writes signal frame (pcb_fsbase/gsbase, all GPRs) to our controlled memory. Potential KASLR leak. |
| 78d | `kevent_evfilt_proc` | PREPARED — NOT RUN | EVFILT_PROC on own PID to capture thread fault events. Older FreeBSD leaked kernel addresses in kn_data/kn_fflags. |
| 80a | `thr_create_cs43_threading` | REJECTED — see 156c | The context is never accepted: it writes `CS`/`SS`/`RFLAGS`/`RIP`/`RSP` at `+0x90..+0xB0` and the length magic at `+0x118`, while the handler validates `+0x108`. Re-run on 2026-10-20 returns `rv = -1` plus a TID that the thread list does not contain. The "no panic" was a rejection, not a thread. The accepted context is in 156c/156d. (2026-10-20) |
| 80b | `thread_rop_chain` | OK | Thread ROP chain execution via thr_create. (2026-10-19) |
| 80c | `thread_register_exec` | REJECTED | `thr_create` returned `rv = -1` and the marker stayed `0x41414141`; the capture itself prints "marker unchanged — thread did not write". No register-controlled execution was observed. (2026-10-19 capture, reviewed 2026-10-20) |

| 80i | `thread_write_final` | UNSUPPORTED | All four captures stop at "calling thr_create" and end in binary bytes; none records a return value or a marker readback, so the DEADBEEF write is not in the evidence.

| 156a | `thr_create_spin_observable` | COMPLETE — no thread | **Existence oracle for `thr_create(430)`.** Same wrong offsets as 80a plus a `jmp $` child and a `thr_kill(433, sig=0)` check. `rv = -1`, a TID was written, `thr_kill(tid, 0) = -1`: the TID is stale. Control `thr_kill(main_tid, 0) = 0`. (2026-10-20) |
| 156b | `ucontext_layout` | COMPLETE — dead | **`thr_get_ucontext(634)` as a layout oracle.** Both `634(buf)` and `634(tid, buf)` return `-1` and leave the 0x400 buffer zeroed, so the real ucontext cannot be read back. (2026-10-20) |

| 157a | `syscall_loop_thread` | COMPLETE — LOOPING THREAD | **A child thread that stays inside the kernel.** `RIP = syscall_address - 7`, the libkernel `mov rax, 116; mov r10, rcx; syscall; ret` wrapper the loader derives from `gettimeofday_import + 7`; `RSP` is a 1 MB page pre-filled with that same address, so each `ret` re-enters the wrapper. The `struct timeval` advanced 21 ms while the main thread ran; `thr_kill(tid, 0) = 0`; sys 624 stayed flat, as `gettimeofday` does no VM work. `thr_kill(tid, 9)` ends the whole process, so the session only ends with a game relaunch. (2026-10-20) |
| 544a | `fcall_stub_layout` | TESTED — LAYOUT CAPTURED | **fcall_stub internal layout.** Dumps fcall_stub fields: fn_addr, rax value, 6 arg slots, chain pointer, native handler address. Confirms native.fcall_with_rax passes 6 args max. (2026-10-25) |
| 544b | `mapdm_7arg` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM 7-arg child thread attempt.** Tried calling sceKernelMapDirectMemory (libkernel+0x15020) from child thread with 7-arg stub. Crash — function is 6-arg, not 7. (2026-10-25) |
| 544c | `mapdm_diag` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM diagnostic.** Main thread MapDM via native.fcall_with_rax with 6 args. Returns rv=0 but subsequent memory operations crash with 0x1337 dump. (2026-10-25) |
| 544d | `alloc_diag` | TESTED — KEY | **AllocateDirectMemory diagnostics.** AllocDM (libkernel+0x17EF0) works via fcall_with_rax: rv=0, phys=0x110010000+. GetDirectMemorySize returns 0x150000000. Pool range 0x100000000-0x150000000. Alignment <0x4000 rejected (0x80020016). First 256MB rejected (0x80020023). (2026-10-25) |
| 544e | `mapdm_real` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM with real AllocDM phys addr.** Child thread 7-arg stub with phys from AllocDM. Hung — 7-arg layout wrong. (2026-10-25) |
| 544f | `mapdm_mainthread` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM main thread 6-arg.** native.fcall_with_rax(MapDM, virt_out, len, prot, flags, phys, align). Returns rv=0, subsequent memory.read crashes. (2026-10-25) |
| 544g | `mapdm_stub_patch` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM with stub field patching.** Modified fcall_stub fields before call. Crash pattern unchanged. (2026-10-25) |
| 544h | `mapdm_readbuf` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM with native.read_buffer.** Used native.read_buffer instead of memory.read_dword after MapDM. Same crash. (2026-10-25) |

| 544k | `mapdm_nativeread` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM + native memory read.** Used native.read_buffer for post-MapDM reads. Same crash. (2026-10-25) |
| 544l | `mapdm_pureprint` | TESTED — PARTIAL | **Pure Lua after MapDM.** Only print/math/string after MapDM. Pure Lua SURVIVES but any C function (memory.*, native.*) crashes. (2026-10-25) |
| 544m | `mapdm_fixedaddr` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM with fixed address hint.** Set *virt_out=0x880000000 before MapDM. Still crashes. (2026-10-25) |

| 544p | `mapdm_flags` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM flag variants.** Tested prot=3, prot=0x33, flags=0/1/0x10/0x400000. All crash. (2026-10-25) |
| 544q | `mapdm_fcalltable` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM with pre-created fcall objects.** Pre-allocated all syscall/native objects before MapDM. Post-MapDM use still crashes. (2026-10-25) |
| 544r | `mapdm_writeonly` | TESTED — CRASH | **MapDM write-only test.** Confirmed both memory.read AND memory.write crash after MapDM. Establishes crash is not read-specific. (2026-10-25) |
| 544s | `mapdm_syscall_after` | TESTED — CRASH | **Syscall after MapDM.** Tests whether make_syscall works post-MapDM. ASLR crash before reaching test. (2026-10-25) |
| 544t | `mapdm_apollo_flags` | TESTED — CRASH | **Apollo loader flags.** Used exact Apollo flags: prot=0x33, flags=MAP_NO_COALESCE(0x400000). Same crash — flags don't fix it. (2026-10-25) |
| 544u | `mapdm_uint64_read` | TESTED — INCOMPLETE | **uint64 read after MapDM.** Child thread attempt, not run cleanly. (2026-10-25) |
| 544v | `mapdm_survive` | TESTED — CRASH | **Survival test.** Ordered minimal tests post-MapDM. ok=true printed then crash at to_num(mrv) — accessing return value object crashes. ASLR-dependent. (2026-10-25) |
| 544w | `mapdm_atomic` | TESTED — CRASH | **Atomic print test.** Individual print statements post-MapDM. "A", "42", "B" printed then crash at string.format — inconsistent crash point confirms ASLR-dependent heap corruption. (2026-10-25) |
| 545a | `mapdm_child` | TESTED — CRASH | **Pre-created syscall after MapDM.** Tests if pre-created make_syscall(20) works post-MapDM. ASLR crash during MapDM. (2026-10-25) |
| 545b | `mapdm_fixedaddr` | TESTED — CRASH | **Fixed address 0x880000000.** Set *virt_out=0x880000000 as hint. MapDM rv=0 but virt_out read still crashes. Kernel ignores hint. (2026-10-25) |
| 545c | `mapdm_failfirst` | TESTED — **ROOT CAUSE** | **Bad-phys MapDM isolation test.** MapDM with invalid phys addr (0xDEADBEEF) returns rv=0 AND memory.read_dword works fine afterward (rd=0x12345678). **Proves crash is caused by the MAPPING overwriting heap, not by the function call itself.** (2026-10-25) |
| 545d | `mapdm_premmap` | TESTED — CRASH | **Pre-mmap + MapDM.** Pre-mapped anon page at 0x880000000, set *virt_out=0x880000000. MapDM rv=0 but virt_out read crashes — kernel ignores the hint address. (2026-10-25) |

Bypasses sceKernelMapDirectMemory entirely. No heap collision, no crash. Physical memory limited to GPU pool (0x100000000-0x150000000). (2026-10-25) |
