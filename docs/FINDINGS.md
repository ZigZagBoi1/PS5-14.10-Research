# Detailed Technical Findings — PS5 14.10

> **Evidence scope (2026-10-18):** The 45c controls concern selected syscall-object metadata mutations, not every loader path. Later 56c/56f captures record selected CClosure redirects to existing Lua C functions with returned values and restoration. Those userland results do not establish arbitrary native calling conventions, a working ROP chain, injected-page execution, kernel R/W, or KASLR defeat. See [the evidence ledger guide](RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.md) and Findings 79/82.

Earlier findings describe their cited probe sets, not a uniform current capability state. Later observations may answer earlier open questions; the 2026-10-17 audits remain dated snapshots.

> **Finding-number collision:** Findings 91–95 are used twice. The 2026-10-23
> AIO/threading block (AIO 662, `thr_new`) and the later UMTX/W^X block both
> start at Finding 91. Cite the finding title alongside the number; renumbering
> is pending a maintainer decision.

## Finding 1: W^X + Execute-Only Memory (XOM)

**Probes:** 26, 26b, 26c, 26d, 26e

The PS5 enforces write-XOR-execute strictly:
- `mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC)` → grants `RW` only (EXEC stripped)
- `mprotect(PROT_EXEC)` → always fails with -1
- Code pages are **execute-only**: attempting to read from the code segment causes SIGBUS
- The crash handler at address `0x533118f4` handles SIGILL/SIGBUS/SIGSEGV; output starts with `77` followed by binary data

**Impact:** No code injection via mmap/mprotect. Must find kernel R/W through data-only paths. Note: eboot .text IS readable (RX, not XO) — probe 272a scanned 4.6MB of eboot gadgets. System library .text pages are XO and unreadable.

---

## Finding 2: Threading Partially Available (CORRECTED 2026-10-23)

**Probes:** 27, 156c, 156d, 383a

~~Original claim: all threading blocked, eliminates race classes entirely.~~ **Superseded.**

- `fork()` — blocked
- `rfork()` — blocked
- `thr_create(430)` — **works** (probes 156c/156d)
- `thr_new(455)` — **works** (probe 383a)
- 136 race result files exist in `results/phase22_threaded_races/`

**Impact:** Race conditions ARE possible. TOCTOU, UAF-via-race, and refcount race classes are NOT eliminated. Thread budget varies per loader: 25/11/9 measured ceilings (probes 242a/244a/245a), not a fixed "8 children max."

---

## Finding 3: sigaltstack Kernel Write is Dead

**Probes:** 22, 23, 24, 25, 25b

The classic sigaltstack trick (set altstack to kernel address → signal delivery writes sigframe there) fails because:
- `copyout()` validates the destination address during signal frame delivery
- Writing to a kernel address triggers EFAULT
- The kernel then kills the process

`sigprocmask` is also a no-op — returns 0 but the signal mask is never modified.

---

## Finding 4: F_SETFL is Cosmetic Only

**Probes:** 30b, 30c, 33a–33c

`fcntl(F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` returns -1 but **updates the visible flags word** (F_GETFL shows the change). However the kernel **does not honor the flags**:
- O_NONBLOCK has no effect on actual read/write behavior
- O_APPEND flag also set but not honored  
- O_ASYNC flag also set but not honored
- Each F_SETFL call REPLACES the flags word (not bitwise OR)

The sandbox intercepts F_SETFL, rejects it (returns -1), but patches the userland-visible flags struct field. The actual kernel I/O path checks a separate internal socket state.

`F_SETOWN` is truly blocked — returns -1 AND the value is not applied (F_GETOWN stays -1). No SIGIO possible.

---

## Finding 5: MSG_DONTWAIT is the Real Nonblocking Mechanism

**Probes:** 33d, 33e, 33f

Since F_SETFL O_NONBLOCK is fake, nonblocking I/O must use per-call flags:
- `sendmsg(fd, msg, MSG_DONTWAIT)` with `MSG_DONTWAIT = 0x80`
- `recvmsg(fd, msg, MSG_DONTWAIT)` with `MSG_DONTWAIT = 0x80`

Confirmed behavior:
- `recv(empty socket)` → returns -1 immediately (EAGAIN)
- `send(full buffer)` → returns -1 immediately (EAGAIN)
- SNDBUF=1 partial writes work correctly (request 4 bytes → rv=1)
- 100x rapid send/recv cycling: 100/100 success
- Both buffers=1, 50x cycling: 50/50 success

**CRITICAL:** `sendto` (syscall 133) and `recvfrom` (syscall 29) **crash the Lua loader** when registered in `syscall.resolve()`. Use only `sendmsg`/`recvmsg`.

---

## Finding 6: SCM_RIGHTS fd Passing Works Correctly

**Probes:** 28, 30b

Unix domain socket credential passing via SCM_RIGHTS is fully functional:
- Can pass 16+ file descriptors in a single message
- 5x send/recv cycle: all 5 correct (refcounts accurate)
- No refcount leak or double-free observed
- Passed fds are usable (can read/write/close)

---

## Finding 7: RAW Socket + IP_HDRINCL = Kernel Packet Injection

**Probe:** 34

This is the **most significant finding** for exploit development:
- `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)` succeeds → fd allocated
- `setsockopt(IP_HDRINCL)` → rv=0 (reads back as 8 = INP_HDRINCL)
- `sendmsg()` with crafted IP+UDP packet to 127.0.0.1 → **packet reaches UDP listener**
- Confirmed: `BEEFCAFE` payload data arrived intact
- RAW socket `bind()` and `connect()` to loopback both work

TCP SYN packet was dropped — likely due to invalid TCP checksum (sent 0). TCP requires valid checksums even on loopback.

**Impact:** We can inject arbitrary IP packets into the kernel's `ip_input()` path. This opens:
- IP fragment reassembly (`ip_reass()`)
- IP options parsing (`ip_dooptions()`)
- Protocol demultiplexing
- ICMP input processing
- Any protocol handler reachable via loopback

---

## Finding 8: Fragment Reassembly — Inconclusive (Bind Issue)

**Probes:** 35, 35b

All fragment reassembly tests returned no data. However, probe 35b revealed the root cause: **`bind()` was returning -1** for the UDP listener port. Without a valid listener, no packets can be received regardless of reassembly.

The bind failure may be due to:
- Port range restrictions on the PS5
- Socket/fd limit reached
- Specific port number filtering

**Status:** Needs re-testing with verified bind success before concluding anything about fragment reassembly.

---

## Finding 9: PS5 Custom Socket Options are Benign

**Probe:** 31c

Five Sony-extended SOL_SOCKET options exist:
```
0x2000, 0x10000, 0x20000, 0x40000, 0x100000
```

All are **boolean flag bits** in the socket's `so_options` field. The option number IS the bitmask value:
- `setsockopt(SO_0x2000, 1)` → readback = 0x2000
- Same behavior on all socket types (UNIX, TCP, RAW, IPv6 RAW)
- No complex parsing, no buffer handling, no kernel pointer exposure

**Not exploitable.**

---

## Finding 10: poll() is Fully Functional

**Probe:** 32c

`poll()` works with correct BSD semantics:
- `nfds=0` → rv=0 (immediate return)
- Invalid fd → POLLNVAL (0x0020)
- `fd=-1` → ignored (standard behavior)
- Closed peer → POLLIN|POLLHUP (0x0051)
- `read(closed peer)` → rv=0 (EOF)
- Mixed fd array → correct per-fd results

---

## Finding 11: TCP_INFO Contains No Kernel Pointers

**Probe:** 31b

The 236-byte TCP_INFO structure was fully dumped and scanned:
- Contains only protocol metadata: timestamps, RTT values, window sizes, congestion state
- Connected vs unconnected socket comparison shows expected field changes
- **No kernel addresses leaked** — all pointer-sized values are protocol counters or timestamps

---

## Finding 12: Memory Layout

**Probe:** 03

Key addresses observed:
- Signal handler (crash): `0x533118f4`
- Code segment is execute-only (cannot read)
- Heap is RW, stack is RW
- `MAP_FIXED` works for page-aligned addresses in userland range

---

## Finding 13: AIO Outcomes Are Not Uniformly Established

**Probes:** 19, 19b–19g, 43p; focused retest 53a prepared, not run.

Older probe summaries describe AIO calls as blocked or as causing the loader to exit, but those summaries do not establish a common kernel-level termination for every call. The raw `19g` record shows `aio_error` returning `rv=-1`. The saved `43p` output ends immediately before its first raw AIO call result, so it supplies no result or kill record for the `make_syscall()` path. It also does not reach the planned Sony syscall scan or test syscall 663.

**Conclusion:** Exact behavior remains scoped to each logged call, argument set, and invocation path. Do not describe the AIO family as completely sandbox-killed or infer a kernel kill from a missing output tail. Retest 53a is prepared to capture per-call outcomes; it has not been run.

---

## Finding 14: kqueue and kevent Work for Tested Filters

**Probes:** 20, 21; see also [CVE-2026-58083 assessment](CVE-2026-58083-PS5-14.10.md)

- `kqueue()` returns a valid fd.
- Probe 20 registered and polled read filters, observed three events, exercised close-while-registered and 200 register/delete rounds, and registered/deleted 50 timer filters (9 timer events observed).
- Probe 21 registered signal and user filters and up to 2,000 knotes. These are bounded API observations, not proof that all filters or races behave correctly.
- The saved runs do not exercise copy-on-fork. The available process-creation run records `fork`, `rfork`, and `thr_new` returning `-1`.
- No use-after-free, kernel corruption, crash, or privilege change was observed or tested by these runs. See the CVE assessment for the evidence boundary.

---

## Finding 15: writev with IOV_MAX Boundary

**Probe:** 30b

- `writev` with 16 iovecs of 64 bytes each (1024 total) → rv=1024 ✓
- `writev` with 1024 iovecs of 1 byte each (1024 total) → rv=1024 ✓
- `writev` with 1025 iovecs → rejected (IOV_MAX=1024)

No buffer overflow at the IOV_MAX boundary. Kernel handles correctly.

---

## Finding 16: Port Bind Policy (probe 36, live)

- Ports **<1024 blocked** (rv=-1), ports **≥40000 blocked**
- Ports 1024–32767 work: 1024, 5000, 8080, 9027, 31337–31340 all bind (UDP+TCP)
- TCP 9026 fails (loader owns it); UDP 9026 binds (different protocol slot)
- INADDR_ANY binds fine; SO_REUSEADDR double-bind correctly rejected
- **This solves the 35/35b mystery:** nothing was wrong with bind on good ports; the earlier failure was port-selection-related

---

## Finding 17: ip_reass() Handles All Standard Cases Correctly (probe 39, live)

With a working listener on 31338, all fragment cases reassemble correctly:
- baseline 2-frag, out-of-order, overlap (-8B), tiny-first (8B), dup-final-overwrite, 9×8B chain — **all delivered with correct data**
- First-fragment-wins on overlap (BSD semantics preserved)
- proto=47 fragments correctly not delivered to UDP listener
- **No crash, no corruption.** Basic ip_reass attack surface is well-behaved; deeper fuzzing (timeout expiry, reassembly queue limits, 64+ fragment chains) still untested.

---

## Finding 18: ip_dooptions() Processes Options but Drops Routed Ones (probe 37, live)

- Well-formed RR/TS/NOP: sent and delivered
- Malformed option lengths (len=0, oversized, truncated): **rejected at send time** (rv=-1) — `ip_output()` validates before `ip_dooptions()` ever runs on loopback. The classic length-confusion cases never reach the parser this way.
- **LSRR, SSRR, TS-overflow-flag: send OK but NOT delivered** — kernel processes the option and drops/redirects the packet. Source routing is disabled, as expected, but this confirms option-processing code runs.
- To reach input-side `ip_dooptions()` with malformed lengths, packets must arrive from the **real network** (PC-side scapy), not loopback injection — output-path validation is the gatekeeper.

---

## Finding 19: Crash Record = ASLR Oracle (probes 41m/41o, live)

The crash handler (magic `0x13371337`) emits a ~280-byte binary record on SIGSEGV:
- `+0x08`: signal number (0x0b = SIGSEGV)
- `+0x28`: fault address (si_addr)
- `+0x20/+0x40/+0x58/+0x60/+0x80/+0xD0`: heap pointers (Lua state registers)
- `+0xB8/+0xF8/+0x100`: **code pointers into the main module**
- Code base shifted 0x2393xxxx → 0x2558xxxx between runs: **per-process ASLR, but the delta is consistent across all code pointers** — one crash leaks the module base.
- Heap base `0x3_10000000` region is stable across sessions; only the top frontier moves.

**Strategic value:** any future PC-control primitive (fake vtable etc.) needs gadget addresses. The crash record hands you the module base every time; gadgets can be resolved offline from a dumped copy of the same binary (Relapse can dump on ≤13.60).

---

## Finding 20: The 0x1A3A4EE0 "vtable" is a Session Artifact (probes 41m–41q, live)

- `0x1A3A4EE0` as a raw address is **unmapped** (SIGSEGV, si_addr confirmed 0x1A3A4E00)
- Full scans of the entire mapped heap `[0x310000000, 0x310DC0000)` plus 4 MB anchor-relative windows: **zero objects with dword 0x1A3A4EE0 exist** in fresh sessions
- The 41i/41k/41l "objects with vtable header" were artifacts of that session's heap spray (41j AFAF spray) — not naturally occurring loader objects
- **Do not chase this value without recreating the 41j spray conditions first**

---

## Finding 21: New Syscall Map (probes 38/42a/42b, live)

**Newly confirmed working:**
- `ktimer_create` (clock 0=REALTIME, 4=MONOTONIC), `ktimer_settime`, `ktimer_getoverrun` — **partially open POSIX timer surface**
- `getsockname` — works
- `accept4`, `preadv`, `pwritev`, `copy_file_range` — resolve and error correctly on bad fds (untested on real fds; no usable file fd exists since memfd is stubbed)

**Newly confirmed blocked/stubbed:**
- `ktimer_gettime`, `ktimer_delete` — blocked even on valid ids (inconsistent with settime being open — odd split)
- `getrandom` — blocked
- `ppoll` — blocked
- `cap_rights_limit/get` — blocked
- `memfd_create` — stub, returns fake fd=1
- itimerspec validation is CORRECT (nsec>1e9, negative, huge sec all rejected)
- Timer cap: 27 concurrent timers

**Incomplete minherit/msync captures (outcome and cause unresolved):**
- `minherit` — probe 38 stops at its isolated minherit section header, with no call result; cause unresolved
- `msync` — probe 42b stops after the msync section prints its region address, with no call result; cause unresolved

---

## Finding 22: Loader Session Model (live observations)

- pid increments across connections (451→458→472→493→500): the loader respawns a fresh process per TCP connection, **fresh ASLR each probe**
- Heap anchors shift per session (0x310878000, 0x310bdcfc0, 0x310e05520…) — all heap scanning must be **anchor-relative**, never hardcoded
- The mapped heap top ends in a guard page (fault at exactly page-aligned 0x310DC0000); scanning UP into the guard kills the process. Scan DOWN from a known-mapped address, or keep progress output flowing to survive the 30s socket timeout.

---

## Finding 23: Early ROP-Chain Interpretation (superseded by probe 45c)

Probes 41v/41z found ROP-shaped metadata in the Lua loader's heap, including writable `fn_addr` and argument slots. At the time, the metadata was mistaken for the active syscall path.

Probe 45c later showed that `make_syscall()` continues to work when `fn_addr` points to NOP, `ud2`, null, or unmapped memory, and when the recorded chain is corrupted. The chain is not an established execution path; the claimed arbitrary-function call and stack-pivot primitives are not confirmed.

---

## Finding 24: Direct Memory Physical Addressing Constraints

**Probes:** 15, 18, 42d, 42f, 42f2, 42g–42g4

- `/dev/dmem0` opens reliably at `fd=22` (or `fd=24`).
- Direct physical mmap survey across 90+ physical offsets revealed:
  - **Offset 0x00000000:** Consistently returns `0x80000000_C0012800` (GPU hardware status/control register).
  - **Offsets > 0x0 up to 4GB:** Return all zeros or fail.
  - **Offsets ≥ 4GB (DRAM range):** Return zeros or fail (`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`).
- **Conclusion:** `/dev/dmem0` is an interface to the GPU's dedicated GDDR6 memory aperture, not system CPU DRAM. It cannot be used to read or modify kernel page tables or kernel data structures directly.

---

## Finding 25: FreeBSD sysarch AMD64 Architecture & Segments

**Probes:** 42b, 42c, 43c

- Standard FreeBSD `<machine/sysarch.h>` defines:
  - `AMD64_GET_FSBASE = 128`
  - `AMD64_SET_FSBASE = 129`
  - `AMD64_GET_GSBASE = 130`
  - `AMD64_SET_GSBASE = 131`
- `sysarch(128)` confirms `FSBASE` holds the userland Thread Control Block (TCB) at `0x88xxxxxxxx`. Scanning the TCB reveals only userland TLS thread pointers.
- Calling `sysarch(129)` with a zero buffer overwrites `FSBASE` to 0, which immediately crashes userland libc.
- `AMD64_GET_GSBASE (130)` queries `%gs:0`, which in FreeBSD points directly to the kernel's `curthread` structure.

---

## Finding 26: Sysctl Tree Traversal and False-Positive Sentinels

**Probes:** 42b, 42c, 42e, 42h2

- Dense memory dumps from `kinfo_proc` (+0x060) and `fstat` (+0x068) frequently show `0xFFFFFFFF_00000000` and `0xFFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF`. These are **sentinel values / bitmasks** (`-1`, `0xFFFFFFFF`), NOT kernel pointers. Real kernel pointers are in the canonical higher half `0xFFFF8xxx_xxxxxxxx`.
- Walking the sysctl MIB tree (`42e`) via `sysctl.name2oid` / MIB exploration shows that Sony's kernel rejects non-leaf MIB queries or returns size 0.
- Live readable leaf MIBs: `kern.version`, `kern.ostype`, `kern.osrelease`, `hw.machine`, `hw.pagesize`, `kern.securelevel` (1024).

---

## Finding 27: Process-Termination Claims and Evidence Gaps

**Probes:** 19, 29, 30, 38, 42a, 42b, 42g2

Several old probe notes describe calls as instant kills, but a truncated socket capture alone cannot distinguish a kernel termination from a Lua failure, connection loss, or capture truncation. The AIO and kenv claims in particular were too broad: 43p ends before its first AIO result, 19g records `aio_error` returning `-1`, and the 42a/42g2 logs stop at the kenv header.
1. `minherit` (probe annotation: syscall 250) — probe 38 ends at its minherit section header without a call result or termination record.
2. `msync` (probe annotation: syscall 226) — probe 42b ends after printing the msync region address, without a call result or termination record.
3. `kenv` (syscall 390) — unresolved: the 42a and 42g2 captures stop at the call header, with no result or kill record.
4. AIO-family outcomes vary across the available records; 19g records `aio_error rv=-1`, while 43p ends before its first AIO result. Do not label all `aio_*` calls as kills. The raw 14.10 AIO retest is pending (53a).
5. Reading Execute-Only Memory (XOM) system lib `.text` sections — unrecoverable userland faults were observed in the cited probes.

---

## Finding 28: sceKernelMtypeprotect (Syscall 585) Returns Success

**Probes:** 42f

Sony's `sceKernelMtypeprotect` (syscall 585) returned `ret=1` — a positive value indicating success with a status code — while all neighboring Sony syscalls (576, 580, 581, 586, 616, 619) returned -1. This syscall changes memory type protections on PS5 and may bypass the standard W^X enforcement that blocks `mprotect(EXEC)`. If `mtype_protect` operates on a different protection domain (GPU memory types, SPU pages), it could grant execute permissions that `mprotect` cannot.

**Impact:** Potential W^X bypass. Probe 43h and 43k test this with actual mmap'd pages and various protection arguments. If RWX can be achieved, arbitrary code execution without ROP becomes possible.

---

## Finding 29: sceKernelGetCpuUsage (Syscall 617) Is Live

**Probes:** 42f

`sceKernelGetCpuUsage` (syscall 617) returned `ret=0` with an empty 8-byte buffer. This is the only other Sony-specific syscall besides 585 that succeeded. PS5 has 16 logical cores (Zen 2 8C/16T), and CPU usage data structures in the kernel typically contain per-CPU scheduler data, thread lists, and pointers to kernel structures. A larger output buffer or per-CPU index argument may reveal kernel addresses.

**Impact:** Potential kernel info leak. Probe 43k tests with various buffer sizes and argument patterns.

---

## Finding 30: kern.msgbuf Returns Data (Partial Read)

**Probes:** 42b

`sysctl kern.msgbuf` (MIB {1, 33}) returned 8 bytes with value `0x7EF710000`. The kernel message buffer (`dmesg`) is typically 32-256KB and contains boot messages including kernel module load addresses, memory layout, driver init data, and KASLR base. The 8-byte value `0x7EF710000` (~34 GB range) could be a direct-map physical address or a pointer to the message buffer region. A full-size read could capture the entire dmesg output with KASLR-defeating addresses.

**Impact:** Most promising KASLR defeat vector. Probe 43j reads the full buffer (up to 64KB) and scans for kernel pointers.

---

## Finding 31: mincore() Works as Memory Residency Oracle

**Probes:** 42i

`mincore()` (syscall 78) returned `ret=0` with `vec=0x1F` (5 consecutive pages resident). This syscall reports whether virtual address pages are backed by physical memory. It can be used as a side-channel oracle: probing page residency at guessed kernel virtual addresses may detect the kernel base without a direct pointer leak (cache-based KASLR defeat). Even if kernel VA probing fails, it maps the full process VA space layout.

**Impact:** Side-channel KASLR oracle. Probe 43l tests kernel VA range probing and process VA space mapping.

---

## Finding 32: PS5 Socket Options Accept Oversized Buffers

**Probes:** 31c

Five PS5-specific socket options (0x2000, 0x10000, 0x20000, 0x40000, 0x100000) all accept `setsockopt(len=256)` with `rv=0`. These are boolean flags (4 bytes) but the kernel accepted 256-byte writes on UDP, TCP, and RAW sockets. If the kernel copies the full user buffer length into a smaller kernel struct field, this is a kernel heap overflow — writing 256 bytes into a 4-byte field would corrupt adjacent kernel heap objects.

**Impact:** Potential kernel heap corruption primitive. Probe 43m tests with progressively larger buffers (up to 4KB) and checks getsockopt return length for over-read indicators.

---

## Finding 33: /dev/hid Opens Successfully

**Probes:** 42c

`/dev/hid` (the HID/Human Interface Device driver) opens with `fd=24`. While ioctl was "blocked" via `syscall.resolve()`, it is untested via `make_syscall(54)`. The HID driver manages PS5 controller/gamepad input and exposes device descriptors, report buffers, and internal state through ioctls. If ioctl works via make_syscall, we gain access to HID kernel state which may contain kernel addresses.

**Impact:** Potential kernel info leak or write primitive via HID ioctls. Probe 43n tests ioctl(54) via make_syscall with standard HID and USB ioctl codes.

---

## Finding 34: thr_self Returns Real Thread ID

**Probes:** 42j

`thr_self()` succeeded with `ret=0`, returning `tid=101819`. While this is not directly a kernel pointer, the thread ID is a handle into kernel thread structures. Combined with other primitives, the TID could be used to locate the `struct thread` in kernel memory (e.g., via `kern.proc.pid` if it leaks `ki_tdaddr`).

**Impact:** Building block for kernel exploitation. The TID value is consistent and identifies the kernel thread object.

---

## Finding 35: fn_addr Encoding Pattern (0x9FE5 Prefix)

**Probes:** 42f, 42g, 42h, 42i, 42j

All fn_addr values across different PIDs share a constant `0x9FE5` upper 16-bit prefix with ASLR-varying middle bits and `0130` suffix:
- PID 582: `0x9FE510A60130`
- PID 610: `0x9FE511078130`
- PID 645: `0x9FE510DF0130`

The `0x9FE5` constant survives ASLR and may encode a non-randomized memory region, a GPU command buffer prefix, or an instruction encoding (`E5 9F` = `IN EAX, 0x9F` on x86-64). Understanding this encoding is key to reliable fn_addr manipulation across connections.

**Status:** The observed prefix pattern is descriptive only. Probe 45c found tested syscall results persisted after specific fn_addr mutations, so the proposed ROP-targeting impact is not established; the field's role and entropy interpretation remain unverified.

---

## Finding 36: AF_ROUTE Request Delivery Was Not Established (probe 43o)

**Probes:** 43o

- `socket(PF_ROUTE=17, SOCK_RAW, 0)` succeeds → `fd=22`
- `RTM_GET` for the default route (0.0.0.0): the write returns -1; successful delivery is not established
- The read returned 108 bytes and zero detected pointers; its attribution to a request echo or a kernel-generated response is unresolved
- Writes for the other tested destinations also fail
- The passive read also reports 108 bytes; the log does not provide a separate byte dump establishing its origin or equality
- The `NET_RT_DUMP`/`NET_RT_IFLIST` fallback branch was not reached in this saved run: it is conditional on socket creation failure, whereas the log records fd=22

**Conclusion:** The AF_ROUTE leak was not validly tested. The failed writes and read of unresolved origin cannot establish either a leak or a 14.10 patch. A corrected retest is prepared as 53b and remains unrun.

---

## Finding 37: Raw AIO Result Is Unresolved (probe 43p)

**Probe:** 43p

- The saved output shows the sysctl canary succeeded, then prints that `aio_error` syscall 317 is about to be called.
- The file ends before any result, error, or post-call canary is printed.
- The planned later Sony syscall scan, including syscall 663, therefore has no result in the saved run.

**Conclusion:** The saved log is incomplete and does not establish the outcome of syscall 317 or the state of Sony syscall 663 on 14.10. Treat both as untested by this artifact; see [the secondary exploit audit](SECONDARY_EXPLOIT_AUDIT_13.60.md).

---

## Finding 38: kldstat/kldsym Results Are Missing (probes 43a, 43b)

**Probes:** 43a, 43b

- The 43a log is 145 bytes and contains only a header
- The 43b log is 116 bytes and contains only a header
- Neither log contains a syscall result, error, or kill record

**Conclusion:** The outcomes and cause of truncation are unknown. KLD introspection has not been established as blocked or successful. Retest 53c is prepared and remains unrun.

## Finding 39: fn_addr and ROP-Field Writes Did Not Alter Tested Calls (probes 43i, 45c)

Probe 43i records writes/readback of `fn_addr` and slot0. Its source restores slot0 before getpid; the modified slot was not tested across that call. The fn_addr sentinel persisted across getpid. Neither observation establishes dispatch control. Probe 45c then changed those fields to invalid targets, corrupted the chain, and observed normal syscall results with no crash.

**Conclusion:** The tested writes did not establish an arbitrary function-call primitive. Probe 45c's calls continued after specific mutations, but the complete dispatch path and the fields' role remain unknown. Do not treat them as kernel read/write.

---

## Finding 40: fstat Works via make_syscall, ioctl/dup Still Blocked (probe 43e)

**Probes:** 43e

- `fstat` (syscall 189) via make_syscall → **works** on fd 0, 3, 4, 5. Returns full stat structs.
  - `+0x68` contains `0xFFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF` — sentinel, not kernel pointer
  - Different inode numbers per fd (0x2A, 0x18, 0x63, 0x64)
  - All files show same timestamps and `st_blksize=0x4000` (16KB = PS5 page size)
- `ioctl` (syscall 54) via make_syscall → returns -1 for FIONREAD, TIOCGETA, SIOCGIFADDR
- `dup`/`dup2` (syscalls 41/90) → return -1
- `thr_new` (syscall 455) → crashed the process (garbled output = crash record)

**Conclusion for probe 43e:** fstat works but leaks no kernel pointers. The tested ioctl and dup calls failed. This probe's `thr_new` failure does not rule out `thr_create(430)`, which was later demonstrated to start a working second thread.

---

## Finding 41: GS Base is Zero, FS Base is Userland (probe 43c)

**Probes:** 43c

- `sysarch(GET_FSBASE=128)` → `0x8817C8080` (userland TCB, expected)
- `sysarch(GET_GSBASE=130)` → `0x0` (zero — no kernel `curthread` pointer leaked)
- `sysarch(GET_XFPUSTATE=132)` → `ret=0`

**Conclusion:** GS base does not contain a kernel pointer on PS5. This is likely because `%gs` is not used for `curthread` in the PS5 kernel variant, or Sony zeroed it in userland context.

---

## Finding 42: Recorded Sysctl Operations (probe 43f)

**Probes:** 43f

- The read and write(-1) labeled `kern.securelevel` each returned -1.
- Reads labeled `kern.coredump`, `security.bsd.unprivileged_proc_debug` and `kern.maxproc` returned -1. Their conditional writes were not reached.
- The read labeled `kern.somaxconn` returned 0/value 1024; no write was attempted.
- Reads labeled `tcp.mssdflt` and `kern.maxfiles` returned -1.

**Conclusion:** `results/43f_sysctl_write_20261016_180756.txt` records one failed write attempt, not a survey proving all sysctl writes blocked. The labels follow the probe's assumed MIB mappings; failed calls do not independently verify those Sony mappings or the cause of failure. See the conditional write branches in `probes/phase10_untested_theories/43f_sysctl_write.lua`.

## Finding 43: Sony Syscall 557 Returns Live Data (probe 43g)

**Probes:** 43g

- Sweep of syscalls 540-650 found **syscall 557 returns `ret=16901`** — a non-error positive value
- The process was killed shortly after (likely hit a kill-trigger syscall in the sweep)
- Syscall 620 also returned `ret=0` (alive but empty)
- All other swept syscalls returned -1

**Conclusion:** Syscall 557 is a live Sony-custom syscall returning meaningful data. Needs targeted investigation with proper arguments. The value 16901 (0x4205) could be a status code, count, or flags.

---

## Finding 44: mtypeprotect Returns 1 for All Protection Values Including RWX (probes 43h, 43k)

**Probes:** 43h, 43k

- `sceKernelMtypeprotect` (syscall 585) returns `ret=1` for all tested protection values:
  - PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC (RX): ret=1
  - PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC (RWX): ret=1
  - PROT_EXEC only: ret=1
  - PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE (RW): ret=1
  - PROT_READ only: ret=1
- After calling mtypeprotect(RWX), the page is still readable and writable
- Standard `mprotect(RX)` still returns -1 on the same page
- Execution test was not performed (safety flag in probe)

**Conclusion:** mtypeprotect consistently returns 1 (success?) but does not appear to change `mprotect`-visible permissions. It may operate on a separate protection domain (GPU memory types) or its return value of 1 may indicate "not applicable" rather than success. Needs execution test to determine if EXEC permission was actually granted.

---

## Finding 45: kern.msgbuf Returns Only 8 Bytes (probe 43j)

**Probes:** 43j

- Size query returns 8 bytes (not the expected 32-256KB dmesg buffer)
- Content: `0x00 0x40 0xBE 0xEF 0x07 0x00 0x00 0x00` — looks like a truncated header or sentinel
- `kern.features` returns `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` (null UUID)
- `kern.boottime` readable: `0x6AD29A84` (Unix timestamp) + microseconds
- `kern.proc.auxv` blocked (ret=-1)

**Conclusion:** kern.msgbuf is heavily filtered — returns a minimal 8-byte stub instead of the full dmesg. No kernel pointers available through this path.

---

## Finding 46: mincore Cannot Probe Kernel VA Space (probe 43l)

**Probes:** 43l

- mincore works correctly on userland mappings (eboot, GPU mmap)
- Returns `vec=[0x0B, 0x0B, 0x0B, 0x09]` for eboot text pages
- **All kernel VA probes return -1**: KERNBASE (0xFFFF8000_*), DMAP (0xFFFFF800_*), high kernel (0xFFFFFF80_*)
- Unmapped userland addresses correctly return -1
- Interesting: address `0x800000000` (32GB) returns ret=0, vec=0x00 (mapped but not resident)

**Conclusion:** mincore validates that the address is in the current process's VA space. Kernel addresses are rejected. No KASLR oracle via mincore.

---

## Finding 47: Socket Options Accept Large Buffers but Don't Overflow (probe 43m)

**Probes:** 43m

- `setsockopt` accepts buffers up to 4096 bytes for SO_SNDBUF (0x1001) and PS5 custom options
- `getsockopt` always returns the correct 4-byte value regardless of input size
- Same behavior on UDP, TCP, and RAW sockets
- Standard options (SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_DONTROUTE, etc.) also accept 256-byte buffers

**Conclusion:** The kernel likely clamps the copy length to the expected option size internally. No kernel heap overflow — the large accept is benign (kernel ignores excess bytes). Not exploitable.

---

## Finding 48: /dev/hid Open but ioctl Returns Sony Error (probe 43n)

**Probes:** 43n

- `/dev/hid` opens at fd=23
- `fstat(/dev/hid)` works — different inode (0x5A) from pipe fds
- All ioctl codes return `-2143617020` (`0x80740004`) — a Sony-specific error code meaning the operation is not supported for this device type
- FIONREAD returns 0 (no data available)
- `read()` returns 0
- `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/urandom` all open successfully
- `/dev/console`, `/dev/tty`, `/dev/bpf`, `/dev/crypto`, `/dev/pf` all blocked

**Conclusion:** ioctl via make_syscall reaches the kernel (not sandbox-killed), but the HID device rejects all tested ioctl codes with a Sony error. The error code `0x80740004` appears device-specific. Other devices (/dev/bpf, /dev/crypto) remain blocked at open().

---

## Finding 49: CpuUsage Returns Empty Data, Syscall 620 Alive (probe 43k)

**Probes:** 43k

- `sceKernelGetCpuUsage` (617) with buffers from 8 to 4096 bytes: ret=0 but all-zero output
- Per-CPU queries (cpu 0-15): all ret=0, zero data
- Various argument patterns (null, 1, -1): all zero
- Syscall 620: ret=0 (another live Sony syscall, unknown function)
- Syscalls 615, 616, 618, 619: all ret=-1
- **Update (2026-11-06):** for 615, the `-1` here was measured with zero/invalid output pointers, so it is an untested contract, not a closed one. Later evidence (113a/185a/186a + the 13.60 contract decode in `docs/SYS_611_613_615_STATS_FAMILY_13_60.md`) shows 615's self path (`615(0, &a, &b)` / self pid) skips the credential gate on 14.10 and writes the class-0 resident count into the first output pointer; the observed `-1` in those runs is the second copyout faulting on the size-slot value. 616/618/619 remain untested contracts.

**Conclusion:** CpuUsage returns success but no data — likely requires specific argument structures or calling conventions not yet discovered. Syscall 620 is alive but unknown.

---

## Finding 50: `mtypeprotect` Did Not Establish Native Code Execution (probes 44a, 45c)

Probe 44a prints its NOP execution-success banner when pcall survives, without requiring a distinguishing side effect. The mov-eax test requested 0x41414141 but returned PID 121. Neither that return nor mtypeprotect ret=1 establishes execution. Probe 45c recorded tested syscall results persisting with NOP, ud2, null, unmapped, and redirected fn_addr values and after selected chain mutations. This contradicts the claimed dependency for those calls but does not identify the complete dispatch path.

**Conclusion:** W^X bypass and native code execution are unconfirmed. A return value of 1 from `mtypeprotect` is not proof that a page became executable or that instructions ran.

---

## Finding 51: Sony Syscall 557 is a Type/Status Query (probe 44b)

**Probes:** 44b

- Returns `0x4205` (16901) **only when arg1 is a valid buffer address**
- Returns -1 with no args, null args, or with arg1 as a small integer
- No data written to the output buffer (0 changed dwords)
- Neighboring syscalls 553-560 all return -1 (14.10 isolation sweep, 2026-10-20). 561 does
  **not** return: it is an absent slot and terminates the process, so this line's original
  "553-561" range was never actually covered at its top end. See
  `docs/SYSENT_PRESENCE_14_10.md`.
- Value breakdown: byte 0 = 0x05 (flags?), byte 1 = 0x42 (type 66?)

**Conclusion:** Syscall 557 appears to be a process type/sandbox level query. The return value itself IS the data (not written to a buffer). The value 0x4205 likely encodes the process sandbox class. Not directly useful for KASLR but documents the sandbox state.

---

## Finding 52: Sockopt Heap Corruption Not Possible (probe 44c)

**Probes:** 44c

- Sprayed 40 sockets around target, wrote 4KB patterns to PS5 custom options
- No corruption detected on any adjacent socket at any buffer size (64-4096)
- SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF reject oversized buffers (ret=-1)
- getsockopt always returns exactly 4 bytes

**Conclusion:** The kernel's `sosetopt()` path clamps the copy to the option's expected size. The large `setsockopt()` acceptance is benign — excess bytes are ignored, not written to kernel heap. Confirmed not exploitable.

---

## Finding 53: Creative Sysctl Paths — NET_RT_IFLISTL Returns 6.5KB (probe 44d)

**Probes:** 44d

- **NET_RT_IFLIST** (MIB {4,17,0,0,3,0}): returns 1408 bytes, no kernel pointers
- **NET_RT_IFLISTL** (MIB {4,17,0,0,5,0}): returns **6536 bytes** of interface data, no kernel pointers
- **kern.usrstack**: returns `0x7EF5A8000` (userland stack top)
- **kern.proc.auxv**: returns only 4 bytes (truncated/filtered: `0x08008011`)
- **kern.proc.sigtramp**: returns 0
- Signal handlers: all at `0x511FD8F4` (userland crash handler address — another ASLR data point)
- Blocked: pathname, groups, rlimit, umask, osrel, cwd, ps_strings, hw.pagesizes

**Conclusion:** NET_RT_IFLISTL provides substantial network interface data but Sony scrubbed all kernel pointers from it. The signal handler address `0x511FD8F4` is consistent with eboot ASLR (confirms the crash handler offset). No KASLR defeat from these paths.

---

## Finding 54: Apparent Shellcode Execution (probe 45a; superseded by 45c)

Probe 45a recorded normal syscall returns and actual_len=2048, initially attributed to shellcode. Its source initialized oldlenp to 0x800, which equals 2048; no length change is established, and the result slot retained its sentinel. Probe 45c later recorded tested calls continuing after specific fn_addr and chain mutations. The 45a observations therefore do not establish that the shellcode ran; the dispatch implementation remains unidentified.

---

## Finding 55: Shellcode Side Effects Were Not Demonstrated (probe 45b; superseded by 45c)

Probe 45b found no observable writes from the proposed shellcode path and noted that return values stayed equal to the process ID. Probe 45c showed tested syscall results persisting after specific fn_addr and chain mutations. Native shellcode execution remains unconfirmed, and the dispatch implementation is unresolved.

---

## Finding 56: Tested Syscall Results Persisted Across fn_addr and Chain Mutations (probe 45c)

**Probe:** 45c (execution reality check)

The completed `results/45c_execution_reality_check_20261016_192713.txt` run reports (the earlier `192602` artifact stops in section B and is not merged with it):

- sysctl(202) returned 1096 bytes with fn_addr set to a NOP+ret page, and again with its original value.
- getpid continued returning PID 135 for the tested fn_addr offsets, including null, an unmapped value, and ud2.
- getpid still returned PID 135 after chain entries 0–7 were overwritten.
- The logged fn_addr value did not match any loaded module text range checked by the probe; the probe skipped reading it because of execute-only memory.

These observations contradict the earlier model for the tested calls: changing those fields did not change their recorded results. They do not show how the loader implements dispatch, whether errors are caught elsewhere, or whether every call path ignores the fields. The checks are from one probe run, not independent replications.

**Conclusion:** These 43i–45c observations do not establish that fn_addr or the ROP-shaped metadata provides a callable function primitive, native code execution, or kernel read/write. Later CClosure redirects (Finding 82) concern a separate mechanism. Treat the earlier execution and W^X interpretations as unsupported. The complete dispatch implementation remains unidentified; see the partial structural observation in Finding 58.

## Finding 57: Syscall 557 Buffer-Modification Claim Was a Probe False Positive (probe 46a)

**Probe:** 46a; saved runs `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_194741.txt` (format-string crash) and `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_195704.txt` (re-run).

The `(0, {size=0x160})` pattern zeroes the struct, writes `0x160` at offset 0, and reports return -1. Its original modification checker compares dwords at offsets `+4..+0x50` against `0xDEADDEAD`, not the initialized zero baseline. An unchanged buffer therefore triggers `struct modified after offset 4!`.

The first dword in the saved dump was supplied by the probe; it is not evidence of a kernel write. The dump contains only the first 64 bytes, less than the checked `+4..+0x53` byte window, so it also cannot establish that the entire window or allocation was unchanged.

**Conclusion:** The earlier claim that this proves the kernel reads and writes the struct is retracted. The probe now passes an explicit zero baseline at this caller and the analogous syscall-620 caller, while sentinel-filled checks retain their original baseline. The actual probe passes the offline Lua 5.1 regression harness, including injected writes and range boundaries; no corrected console run has been performed. Interface identity and kernel effects remain unestablished. See [the 14.10 evidence correction and retest plan](SYSCALL_557_14_10_EVIDENCE.md).

## Finding 58: Syscall Objects Share a C-function __call (probe 46b; implementation unknown)

Probe 46b's partial log reports that syscall entries are Lua tables sharing a metatable at 0x3110237c0. It labels __call at 0x311023aa0 as a C function and also lists __tostring, create_initial_chain, new, arg_addr, and chain fields. The output ends during Section D.

This is a structural observation, not a disassembly of the function. It does not establish what __call invokes, whether it uses a syscall instruction, or how it relates to the ROP-shaped data. Probe 45c's results show only that selected calls persisted after the tested metadata mutations.

**Conclusion:** The loader's complete dispatch implementation remains unknown. Do not treat the reported C-function address or metatable layout as a redirection primitive; further analysis must first identify the function's implementation and validate effects in a controlled test.

## Finding 59: socketpair Works via make_syscall — New IPC Primitive (probe 46d)

**Probe:** 46d (socket bypass)

- `socketpair(AF_LOCAL, SOCK_STREAM)` via make_syscall → **ret=0, fd0=22, fd1=23** — works!
- `socketpair` does not exist in `syscall.resolve()` (nil)
- Socket creation is otherwise identical between make_syscall and resolve — no hidden socket types
- SCTP still fails (-1) via both paths
- TCP connect-back to PC timed out (no server running)

socketpair gives us a bidirectional local IPC channel within the same process. This could be useful for: self-pipe tricks, poll/select testing, or as a data channel if we find code execution.

## Finding 60: Recorded Syscall 557 Return Patterns (probes 47a, 46a re-run)

**Probes:** 47a (version sweep 0-255), 46a (re-run with format fix)

The saved runs must not be merged into a per-connection formula. The two 46a patterns also change the header layout, not just a version value:

| Saved capture | Dwords initialized at offsets `+0`, `+4` | Recorded return |
|---|---|---:|
| `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_194741.txt` | `0x200`, `0` | 16901 |
| `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_194741.txt` | `1`, `0x200` | 518 |
| `results/47a_dispatch_deep_20261016_195632.txt`, version sweep | `0`, `0x200` | 16901 |
| `results/47a_dispatch_deep_20261016_195632.txt`, version sweep | `1`, `0x200` | 518 |
| `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_195704.txt` | `0x200`, `0` | 1038 |
| `results/46a_sony_syscall_deep_20261016_195704.txt` | `1`, `0x200` | 1039 |

Within 47a's version sweep, positive versions 1–255 follow `return = 517 + version`; version zero is an exception. The same displayed `0`, `0x200` header later returns 1034 in that run's size sweep, which initializes a different extent of the allocation. This is an observed confound, not evidence for its cause or a fixed kernel interface.

Finding 57 explains why 46a's struct-modification alarm is a probe artifact, not evidence of a write primitive. 47a's sentinel checks monitor only offsets `+8..+0x1FF`; their no-modification messages are not universal negatives. No kernel pointer or exploit was demonstrated. A resource/allocation-metric interpretation remains a hypothesis; see [the source and capture citations](SYSCALL_557_14_10_EVIDENCE.md).

The saved 46a re-run records return 0 for the tested syscall-620 calls. Its zero-struct dump uses the same incorrect sentinel baseline and is not write evidence. These limited observations do not prove syscall 620 is universally inert.

## Finding 61: CClosure Write Test Skipped — Address Parse Bug in 47a (probe 47a)

Probe 47a's critical Section C (writable CClosure function pointer test) produced **zero output** because the `__call` address `"function: 3108dbaa0"` has no `0x` prefix — the regex `match("0x([0-9a-fA-F]+)")` returns nil. The entire CClosure scan was silently skipped.

This parse issue was addressed by 47b. The remaining evidence gap is separate: 47b's write loop omitted offset +0, so it does not establish whether the C function pointer is writable. Retest 53d covers the missing offset and restores each tested value immediately; it does not attempt control-flow redirection.

Key chain metadata from 47a Section B:
- `chain.stack_base = 0x3109b60f0` (ROP chain base)
- `chain.jmpbuf = 0x3109b8130` (longjmp buffer — could be writable!)
- `chain.recover_from_call = 0x3109b8100`
- `chain.fcall_stub = table: 3108d00e0`
- `chain.retval_addr = table: 3108ae100`
- `chain.finalized = true`, `chain.enable_mock_push = false`

## Finding 62: SCM_RIGHTS Over Socketpair — Incomplete (probe 47a)

sendmsg with SCM_RIGHTS on socketpair succeeds (ret=4) and recvmsg succeeds (ret=4), but the cmsg data was all zeros — the ancillary data wasn't properly received. Either the cmsg buffer layout is wrong, or the kernel stripped the control message. LOCAL_PEERCRED returns uid=1, gid=1, pid=0 — sandbox credentials.

## Finding 63: CClosure C Function Pointer Writability Is Unresolved (probe 47b) ★★

**Probe:** 47b (CClosure hijack — fixed uint64 format bug)

The 47b log examined a CClosure, but its write loop covered offsets `{16,24,32,40,48}` and omitted `+0`. The log also labels `+16` writable in one section while other sections make conflicting statements about the candidate at `+0`.

| Offset | Value | Writable | Purpose |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| +0 | `0x3_105AF820` | **NOT TESTED** | Candidate pointer; write loop omitted this offset |
| +8 | `0x206` | — | Type flags |
| +16 | `0x3_105AF820` | CONFLICTING | Log labels this writable in one section; interpretation is inconsistent |
| +24 | `0x3_104CE000` | Reported writable | Field role is not independently established |
| +32 | `0x3_10549160` | Reported writable | Field role is not independently established |
| +40 | `0xF8AFAFAF_AFAFAFAF` | Reported writable | The log calls it sentinel/padding; no dispatch effect is shown |
| +48 | `0x1_83D58EE0` | Reported writable | Value range alone does not identify it as executable code |

**No conclusion about offset +0 is supported.** The `+16` observation is inconsistent across the log, so it should not be used to infer the layout or control-flow behavior. Retest 53d checks all relevant qword offsets and records restoration status.

**ROP chain and `fn_addr`:** probe 45c demonstrated that `make_syscall()` continues to work when those metadata fields are invalidated or the chain is corrupted. Their writability does not show that this dispatch path consumes them.

**Status for the original probe set:** no native execution was established through fn_addr/ROP. Probe 45c contradicts that dependency for tested calls without identifying the dispatcher. Later 53d records writes/restoration, and 56c/56f record selected CClosure redirects; see Finding 82. These do not validate the earlier fn_addr model.

---

## Finding 64: SCTP Raw Socket Available — New Kernel Attack Surface (probe 48a) ★★

**Probe:** 48a (SCTP/IPv6/ICMP protocol availability sweep)

SCTP raw sockets are available on the PS5:
- `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, 132)` returns fd=22 — **SCTP raw socket open**
- SCTP stream/dgram/seqpacket all fail (-1) — only raw mode works
- SCTP/INET6 stream and seqpacket also fail

SCTP is a complex protocol with its own state machine, chunk processing, and association management in the FreeBSD kernel (`netinet/sctp_*`). Raw SCTP sockets allow crafting arbitrary SCTP chunks that hit the kernel's SCTP input path — a large, rarely-audited code surface.

**Impact:** SCTP input processing (init/cookie/data/sack/heartbeat chunks) is a fresh kernel attack surface. FreeBSD's SCTP implementation has had historical vulnerabilities. Crafted SCTP packets from the PC to PS5 can exercise this code.

---

## Finding 65: IPv6 Fully Available — TCP, UDP, RAW, ICMPv6 All Open (probe 48a) ★★

**Probe:** 48a

IPv6 is fully operational:
- TCP/IPv6: OPEN (fd=22)
- UDP/IPv6: OPEN (fd=22)
- RAW/IPv6: OPEN (fd=22)
- ICMPv6/IPv6: OPEN (fd=22)
- DGRAM/IPv6 proto=0: OPEN
- IPV6_V6ONLY default=1, can be disabled (dual-stack possible)
- 17 IPv6 raw protocols available (0,1,2,6,17,41,47,50,51,58,59,89,103,112,132,136,255)

**Impact:** IPv6 adds entire parallel kernel code paths — NDP, IPv6 fragment reassembly, extension header processing, ICMPv6 handling. These are separate implementations from IPv4 and represent substantial untested kernel attack surface.

---

## Finding 66: 143 Raw IPv4 Protocols All Create Sockets (probe 48a)

**Probe:** 48a

Every IP protocol number from 0 to 142 successfully creates a SOCK_RAW socket. Notable named protocols: HOPOPT(0), ICMP(1), IGMP(2), IP-in-IP(4), TCP(6), UDP(17), IPv6-encap(41), GRE(47), ESP(50), AH(51), ICMPv6(58), OSPF(89), PIM(103), VRRP(112), SCTP(132), UDPLite(136).

Socket option enumeration on a UDP socket shows standard SOL_SOCKET options (SNDBUF=9216, RCVBUF=42080) and IPPROTO_IP options including IP_OPTIONS (len=0), IP_RECVOPTS, IP_RECVRETOPTS, IP_RECVDSTADDR, IP_IPSEC_POLICY, IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR.

**Impact:** Socket creation and send results do not independently establish delivery to each protocol's input handler or handler coverage. Protocols like GRE, ESP, AH, IGMP, PIM, VRRP have complex parsers that may not be hardened on PS5.

---

## Finding 67: IP Options Listener Works, Awaits PC-Side Injection (probe 46c)

**Probe:** 46c (IP options listener)

The PS5 successfully:
- Created UDP socket (fd=22) and bound to port 31338
- Set IP_RECVOPTS sockopt (ret=0)
- Created RAW(UDP) socket (fd=23) for IP header access
- Ran 1200-iteration receive loop (120s window)

Received 0 packets — the PC-side `ip_fragment_inject.py` was not running during the window. The listener infrastructure works; this is a coordinated two-machine test requiring simultaneous PC+PS5 execution.

**Impact:** Test infrastructure validated. When run with PC-side injection, this will test whether IP options survive to the PS5 application layer and whether malformed options can trigger kernel bugs in `ip_dooptions()`.

---

## Finding 68: SCTP Chunk Parser Handles All 39 Fuzz Variants Without Crash (probe 48b)

**Probe:** 48b (SCTP loopback fuzz via raw IP + IP_HDRINCL to 127.0.0.1)

Sent 39 malformed SCTP packets to loopback via `sendto()` on raw socket with IP_HDRINCL. All packets delivered successfully (ret = packet length). No crashes.

Variants tested: INIT with len=0/1/3/0xFFFF, vtag!=0, 0/0xFFFF streams, rwnd=0; ABORT with T-bit; SHUTDOWN cum_tsn=max; ERROR cause_len=0; HEARTBEAT 124B payload; COOKIE_ECHO garbage/empty; COOKIE_ACK no-assoc; SACK with 100 gaps/max gaps+dups/undersized; multi-chunk INIT+ABORT, double INIT, 50 ABORTs, type 0-15 chain; unknown chunk types 62-255 with all action bits; FWD_TSN max/48 streams. Also sent 5 variants to LAN IP (10.0.0.96).

**Impact:** The SCTP chunk parser (`sctp_input()` → `sctp_process_init()` etc.) is robust against basic malformed chunks. Deeper attacks needed: established SCTP associations (INIT→INIT-ACK→COOKIE-ECHO→COOKIE-ACK handshake), state-dependent chunks (DATA/SACK/FWD-TSN on live associations), and timing-based attacks.

## Finding 69: IPv6 Extension Header Parser Handles All 83 Fuzz Variants Without Crash (probe 48c)

**Probe:** 48c (IPv6 extension header fuzz via raw IPv6 socket to ::1)

Sent 83 malformed IPv6 packets with crafted extension headers. Zero crashes, zero send errors.

Sections tested:
- **Hop-by-Hop (B):** PadN overrun (len=100), len=255 with 8B sent, Router Alert, Jumbo 4GB, unknown types with all action bits (0x40/0x80/0xC0/0x3F/0x7F/0xBF/0xFF), double HBH
- **Routing (C):** Type 0 CVE (deprecated), segleft=255 overflow, Type 2 MobileIPv6, unknown type 255, len=0 with segleft=10 underflow, len=255 truncated
- **Fragment (D):** Start reassembly, max offset (8191), overlapping fragments, atomic fragment, 32 fragment bomb IDs, nested fragment headers
- **Destination Options (E):** Home Address (MobileIPv6), unknown types with action bits
- **Chained Headers (F):** Full chain (HBH→RH→Frag→Dest→None), 16-deep nesting, self-loop, HBH not first, Routing→HBH mid-chain
- **ICMPv6 (G):** NS too short, NS option length=0 (parser loop risk), RA max lifetimes, Redirect option length=0, Echo 1KB, unknown types 200-255
- **No Next Header (H):** payload_len=0, payload_len=16 with next=59
- **Payload Length (I):** len=0 with data, len=65535 truncated, version=4/0 confusion

**Impact:** The saved 48c run reports 83 packets, zero send errors and COMPLETE. This establishes continued probe output after those sends, not complete parser/handler coverage or general hardening. Next-level attacks: actual IPv6 fragment reassembly with real first+last fragments, NDP cache poisoning with valid checksums, and IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling edge cases.

## Finding 70: TCP_INFO Leaks Sequence Numbers at Offsets +108/+112 (probe 49a) ★★

**Probe:** 49a (TCP stateful injection via loopback)

TCP_INFO (236 bytes on PS5, getsockopt level=6 optname=32) exposes exact TCP sequence numbers:
- **Offset +108 (dword):** SND_NXT — changes by exact byte count of sent data
- **Offset +112 (dword):** RCV_NXT — changes by exact byte count of received data

Observed values — Before data exchange: CLI +108=`0x7F10A75E`, SRV +108=`0x57DB27AD`. After client sends 100B, server sends 50B: CLI +108=`0x7F10A7C2` (+100), SRV +108=`0x57DB27DF` (+50).

Differential analysis method: dump TCP_INFO before and after sending a known number of bytes, scan for dwords that changed by exactly that count. This reliably identifies sequence number fields without needing FreeBSD header definitions.

Combined with loopback checksum bypass (if_simloop sets CSUM_DATA_VALID), this enables injection of crafted TCP segments into live connections with exact sequence/ack targeting.

**Impact:** New primitive. TCP_INFO seq number extraction + raw IP socket + loopback checksum bypass = ability to inject arbitrary TCP segments into established connections. Critical for targeting deep TCP state machine code (SACK processing, challenge ACK, persist timer).

---

## Finding 71: TCP State Machine Handles 182 Injected Segments Without Crash (probe 49a)

**Probe:** 49a (TCP stateful injection via loopback)

Injected 182 crafted TCP segments into an ESTABLISHED loopback connection. Zero crashes.

Sections tested:
- **RST injection (D):** exact-seq RST, SYN-in-ESTABLISHED, FIN+ACK, RST+SYN combo, all-flags 0xFF, zero-window, window-shrink, URG pointer past data (past/future), future/past seq data, future ACK
- **TCP options (E):** SACK 1-block, 4-block max, left>right invalid, overlapping, zero-width, len mismatch, in-window SACK, timestamp PAWS violation (future/past), MSS in non-SYN, WinScale in non-SYN, TCP-MD5 fake digest, unknown option kind=253, option length=0 (parser crash target), length=1 undersize, length=255 overread
- **State transitions (F):** data after FIN, RST in TIME_WAIT, SYN recycle, 100 ACK storm, 50 SYN flood to random ports

Notable: RST injection with exact seq did NOT tear down the connection (state remained ESTABLISHED=4). This observation alone does not establish RFC 5961 challenge ACK behavior; no challenge/response exchange is demonstrated by that state value.

Ports ≥40000 are blocked (bind returns -1) — use ports 1024-32767.

**Impact:** The saved 49a run reports 182 injected segments and reaches COMPLETE. It does not independently establish which handler paths processed each segment, complete TCP coverage or RFC compliance. Deeper targets: race conditions with simultaneous data transfer + injection, or kernel timer manipulation via persist/keepalive.

---

## Finding 72: IPv6 Fragment Reassembly Handles 280 Fragments Without Crash (probe 49b)

**Probe:** 49b (IPv6 fragment reassembly state attacks)

Sent 280 IPv6 fragments targeting the kernel's ip6_reass() reassembly code. Zero crashes, zero send errors.

Sections tested:
- **Baseline (B):** 2-fragment, 3-fragment, out-of-order, reverse-order reassembly
- **Overlapping (C):** exact duplicate, teardrop (different data at same offset), fully contained, overlapping last fragment, conflicting last fragments (different total lengths), zero-offset overlap with different sizes
- **Tiny/minimum (D):** minimum 8-byte fragments, sub-minimum (4B) with MF=1, zero-length payload, 8 minimum-size chain, gap in fragment offsets
- **Queue exhaustion (E):** 50 incomplete reassemblies (first-frag-only), 101-fragment bomb (6432B total), fragment ID reuse after completion
- **Huge totals (F):** max-size reassembly (65535B), over-max (65592B), way-over-max (65784B)
- **Edge cases (G):** atomic fragments (off=0 MF=0), atomic interrupting pending reassembly, fragment ID=0, ID=0xFFFFFFFF, 3 simultaneous reassemblies
- **Offset boundaries (H):** fragments with gaps, swiss-cheese pattern, gap-filling, late large first fragment
- **Extension header combos (I):** HBH+fragment, Routing+fragment, DestOpt+fragment, nested fragment-in-fragment
- **Interleaving (J):** 3 interleaved IDs, 10 interleaved with reverse completion, same ID from different sources
- **ICMPv6 fragments (K):** fragmented Echo Request, fragmented NDP Router Solicitation
- **Payload length (L):** declared vs actual mismatch, zero payload length with fragment

**Impact:** `results/49b_ipv6_frag_reassembly_20261016_205926.txt` reports 280 fragments sent, zero send errors and COMPLETE after the listed overlap, queue-stress, size and header-combination cases. This does not independently establish which reassembly paths were exercised, complete handler coverage or RFC 5722 compliance.

---

## Finding 73: Exotic Protocol Handlers All Robust — 86 Packets, No Crashes (probe 50a)

**Probe:** 50a (IGMP, GRE, ESP, AH, PIM, OSPF, VRRP + batch protocol sweeps)

Sent 86 packets across 8 protocol families via raw socket + IP_HDRINCL to loopback:
- **IGMP (B):** general/specific query, v1/v2 report, v2 leave, v3 report with 65535 groups/sources (truncated), truncated (4B), zero-length, unknown type 0xFF
- **GRE (C):** basic encap, checksum/key/sequence flags, all flags, recursive GRE-in-GRE, truncated, zero-length, version 1 (PPTP), IPv6 payload, reserved flags + bad version
- **ESP (D):** SPI=0/1/0xFFFFFFFF, truncated (4B), zero-length, 512B payload
- **AH (E):** basic, SPI=0, truncated (8B), payload_len=0/255, zero-length
- **PIM (F):** Hello, Register, Assert, unknown type 15, version 0, truncated (1B), zero-length
- **OSPF (G):** Hello, zero-length, truncated (8B)
- **Misc (H):** EGP, L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IPv6-in-IPv4 (hop limit=0), VRRP, experimental proto 253, proto 0 (HOPOPT), batch sweeps of protos 3-7, 9-15, 60-70, 130-142

**Impact:** All exotic protocol input handlers are robust against basic malformed packets. The kernel drops invalid packets cleanly without crashing. These protocols may still have deeper state-dependent bugs (e.g., GRE tunnel establishment, IGMP group membership state).

---

## Finding 74: TCP Keepalive Options Blocked by Sandbox (probe 50b)

**Probe:** 50b (timer manipulation — partial, timed out after Section A)

TCP keepalive socket options are blocked:
- `SO_KEEPALIVE=1`: works (ret=0)
- `TCP_KEEPIDLE=1`: ret=-1 (blocked)
- `TCP_KEEPINTVL=1`: ret=-1 (blocked)
- `TCP_KEEPCNT=1`: ret=-1 (blocked)
- MAX values (all three): ret=-1

Write after peer close: succeeded (ret=16). 50x rapid keepalive toggle: survived.

The probe timed out after Section A (keepalive) — likely stalled on a blocking timer/sleep operation in a later section. Sections B-H (linger, timeouts, buffer resize, shutdown races) were not reached.

**Impact:** TCP keepalive timer manipulation is blocked at the setsockopt level. The kernel doesn't allow tuning keepalive intervals from this sandbox. Timer-based UAF attacks via keepalive are not viable.

---

## Finding 75: Sandbox FD Limit is ~63 (probe 50c)

**Probe:** 50c (resource exhaustion — partial, timed out after Section A)

TCP connection flood hit the fd limit at 63 connections (target was 200). Socket creation starts failing after fd=63 — this is the sandbox's file descriptor limit. All 63 connections were cleanly closed afterward.

The probe then attempted backlog flood (100 connects to listen backlog=1) and timed out — likely blocked on connect() to a full backlog.

**Impact:** The sandbox limits each process to ~63 open file descriptors. This constrains resource exhaustion attacks but also means fd exhaustion is easy to trigger. Combined with raw sockets using fd slots, heavy socket operations could starve the process of fds.

---

## Finding 76: Probe 50d Consistently Crashes Loader (probe 50d)

**Probe:** 50d (cross-protocol tunneling)

50d consistently returns 0 bytes and kills the Lua loader. After 50d is sent, all subsequent probes (including `print("PING")`) also return 0 bytes until the loader is manually restarted on the PS5.

After loader restart, 50c works (produces output), confirming the loader is functional. Sending 50d immediately kills it again. Even a minimal version with just the helper functions and a raw socket creation (identical to 50a's working code) fails after 50d has run.

The crash is persistent across connections — 50d doesn't just kill the per-connection process, it puts the loader itself into a broken state where it accepts TCP connections but doesn't execute Lua.

**Possible causes:**
1. A Lua parse error specific to 50d's source that corrupts the loader's Lua state
2. The raw socket proto=255 + tunnel packet construction triggering a kernel state corruption that affects the loader process
3. Memory corruption from the tunnel packets that persists in the loader's address space

**Impact:** This is the most interesting failure mode observed — a probe that reliably kills the entire loader, not just the per-connection process. Needs the probe-writing session to debug the Lua source for parse errors, or this could be a real kernel/loader bug.

---

## Finding 77: Sony Syscall Survey Output Is Partial (probe 51a)

The saved log `results/51a_sony_syscall_survey_20261016_214814.txt` says it attempted 110 calls, but contains 55 per-syscall result records. The later zero-argument rerun contains only 29 records and stops at syscall 560. Treat the survey as partial; it does not establish coverage of the full 532–676 range.

In the saved records, calls 596, 572, and 563–566 returned 0, and call 624 returned 3377. A return of 0 only establishes that this argument pattern returned successfully. A return of -1 is ambiguous without captured `errno` and valid arguments; it does not prove a syscall is blocked or absent.

## Finding 78: Deep Sony-Syscall Checks Did Not Find a Kernel Pointer (probe 51b)

The saved `51b_accessible_syscall_deep` log records 30 call patterns. It adds successful zero-argument returns for 585, 606, and 643, and a zero return from 640 with a zero-filled output buffer. Together with 51a, this identifies several calls worth understanding, but not a vulnerability.

The output buffers exercised in this probe contained no observed kernel pointers. The 624 return changed from 3377 to 3376 between separate connections; this is not enough to establish a counter, side channel, or kernel-state leak.

Other evidence limits the interpretation:

- Probe 46a/47a characterized syscall 557's return as a version-dependent formula; the `%b` formatting error interrupted the first run. No kernel pointer or memory corruption was demonstrated.
- Probe 51c saved only results for syscalls 625 and 626, so its claimed 54-call survey did not complete in the available log.
- Probe 51b's later `dynlib_cluster_fuzz` file contains only the header and start of phase 1; it has no usable results.

The raw result files are the source of truth. Success returns from unusual syscall numbers should be treated as behavior to characterize, not as evidence of an exploit primitive.

---

## Finding 79: CClosure +0x20 Target Bytes and Write Boundary (probes 55g, 54r)

**Probes:** 55g, 54r, 54q, 53d

Probe 55g wrote `old_value + 1` to the low dword of type()'s CClosure+0x20 field. The saved capture records MARKER_BEFORE_DIFFERENT_WRITE, then binary output and capture termination, without a completed-write or returned-call marker. That capture alone does not confirm a process crash or identify the executed instruction stream or termination cause. Later 56c returned discriminating outputs after selected +0x20 target changes, supporting a dispatch-field interpretation for those functions.

Key evidence:
- **55g section [H]**: `MARKER_BEFORE_DIFFERENT_WRITE` printed before binary output; no returned-call or completed-write marker identifies the instruction executed or the termination cause.
- **55g sections [D]-[F]**: Selected different-value writes to +0x00 and +0x18 returned without a recorded behavioral change. This does not prove that only +0x20 can affect dispatch.
- **55g section [A]**: CClosure lives in SceLibcHeap (region 74, prot=0x3 = RW, flags=0x0). Fully writable from userland.
- **54r**: All seven tested C functions' +0x20 targets decode as `push rbp; mov rbp, rsp` (bytes `55 48 89 E5`) — standard x86-64 function prologues in eboot's RX .text section.
- **54q limitation**: The capture ends before the post-write marker. A successful redirect, a tonumber loop, and an internal call to type() are hypotheses, not observed returned effects.

**Impact:** Writability, target bytes and a truncated write do not alone establish arbitrary execution. Finding 82 supplies later returned-value evidence for selected existing Lua C targets. A general native ABI, working ROP chain and injected-page execution remain unverified.

**Candidate CClosure layout (55g section [B]; role labels are inferred from layout and selected later behavior, not exact-build source):**
| Offset | Value | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| +0x00 | next GCObject pointer | GC linked list |
| +0x08 | type/flags tag (0x00010206) | Lua type metadata |
| +0x10 | gclist pointer | GC list |
| +0x18 | env table pointer | Lua environment |
| +0x20 | **C function pointer** | **DISPATCH TARGET** |
| +0x28 | 0xF8AFAFAF_AFAFAFAF | Poison/padding |
| +0x30 | eboot-range pointer | Unknown (secondary code ptr?) |
| +0x38 | 0x47 | nupvalues or flags |

---

## Finding 80: Syscall 624 is a VM Operation Counter (probe 52b)

**Probe:** 52b

Syscall 624 returns a monotonically increasing integer that increments by exactly +5 for each `mmap` call, regardless of the mapping size (1 page or 16 pages). It does not decrement on `munmap`. It is unaffected by socket creation, kqueue, memory.alloc, or dynlib_get_info.

Key evidence:
- Section 2: 16 mmap calls of varying size (1-16 pages), each incremented by exactly +5
- Section 3: 512-page mmap, touching pages caused only +1 total delta (not per-page)
- Section 4: 100 tight samples showed zero jitter (all identical = 3463)
- Section 5: sockets (+0), kqueue (+0), memory.alloc (+0), dynlib_get_info (+0)

**Impact:** This is a process-level VM operation counter / budget meter. It counts kernel VM operations, not pages or bytes. It could serve as a side channel to detect kernel VM activity triggered by other syscalls, but is not directly exploitable. The +5 per mmap suggests 5 internal kernel VM operations per mapping (create vm_object, insert into pmap, wire pages, update accounting, etc.).

---

## Finding 81: Syscall 631 is Lethal (probe 52a)

**Probe:** 52a

The syscall survey 627-676 reached sys 631 with zero arguments and the process was immediately killed. Syscalls 627-630 all returned PCALL-FAIL (exception caught by pcall). Sys 631 kills past pcall. Note: thr_new is NOT lethal — it works (probe 383a). Under a SIGSYS harness (probes 353a/353b), 631 and 661 return -1 rather than killing. The "lethal trio" is reduced to two syscalls that kill only without signal handling.

---

## Finding 82: Controlled CClosure Function Redirect Confirmed (probe 56c)

**Probe:** 56c

The saved 56c capture records output and restoration after four selected CClosure +0x20 target changes:
- rawequal → rawget: `rawequal(t, "foo")` returned `"bar"` (rawget behavior)
- rawget → type: `rawget(42, "x")` returned `"number"` (type behavior)
- select → tostring: the printed result is `42`; the capture stringifies it and does not independently record its Lua type
- rawequal → tostring: the printed result is `42`, also without a captured type check

Write+restore cycles take 0.0001s each (10 cycles in 0.0007s). All functions restored correctly after redirect.

**Constraint:** Earlier type()-targeting captures stop around the attempted write. The proposed explanation that memory.write_dword internally calls type() requires exact-build source/disassembly evidence. The tested rawequal/rawget/select changes returned; this does not prove all other functions redirect safely.

**Impact:** A/B provide discriminating output consistent with controlled redirection to selected existing Lua C functions. Later 56f also records string.len/math.abs target-like values and restoration. The 111606/111610 56c files are byte-identical captures, not independent replications. The 56e gadget experiments record nil returns; they do not establish a working general ROP chain. Arbitrary native targets, machine-register argument control, injected-page execution and kernel access do not follow from these records. See [the hash-pinned ledger guide](RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.md).

---

## Finding 83: SCM_RIGHTS fd Drop-Leak (probes 151d, 151e) — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 151d, 151e

When receiving a Unix-domain socket message with `SCM_RIGHTS` and `controllen=0`, the kernel installs the passed file descriptors into the receiver's fd table anyway (FreeBSD should close them). Probe 151d/151e measured this: 5 drops moved next-fd from 34 to 46; leaked fds are functional (`fcntl`, `mmap`, `close` all work), are distinct objects, and writes through them are visible.

**Impact:** fd-leak / exhaustion primitive against the receiver's fd budget. Not memory corruption, but a violation of the expected SCM_RIGHTS semantics. Could be chained with fd-sensitive operations.

---

## Finding 84: msync MS_INVALIDATE Closed on 14.10 (probes 58a-124a) — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 58a, 58b, 58e, 58f, 121e-h, 124a

`msync(addr, len, MS_INVALIDATE)` returns -1 across all mapping classes tested (GPU mmap, shm, anonymous). Control calls `MS_SYNC` and `MS_ASYNC` return 0. CVE-2026-49418 (device-pager UAF via MS_INVALIDATE) is dead on 14.10.

**Impact:** The MS_INVALIDATE device-pager UAF attack vector is closed. Remove from priority lists.

---

## Finding 83: POSIX Shared Memory Fully Functional (probes 57d, 57e)

**Probes:** 57d, 57e

POSIX shared memory operations work on PS5 14.10:
- `shm_open(482)` returns valid fd (22). O_CREAT|O_RDWR with mode 0666.
- `shm_unlink(483)` returns 0 (success).
- `ftruncate(480)` on shm fd works — sets size to requested value.
- `mmap(477)` with MAP_SHARED on shm fd works — returns valid mapping address.
- Read/write through mapping confirmed (wrote 0xCAFEBABE, readback matched).
- `shm_open2(571)` is **LETHAL** — instantly kills process.

**Impact:** POSIX shared memory provides a file-like kernel object with mmap support. The shm_open2 block prevents largepage shm (needed for CVE-2026-49428). Regular shm is usable for data staging and potential kernel object manipulation.

---

## Finding 84: sendfile + SF_NOCACHE on shm Works But Doesn't Free Pages (probes 57e, 57f)

**Probes:** 57e, 57f

- `sendfile(393)` from shm fd to socket: ret=0, sent=4096 (works).
- `sendfile` with `SF_NOCACHE` (0x10): ret=0, sent=4096 (works).
- After three rounds of sendfile+SF_NOCACHE, all 16 mapped pages still read their original pattern (0x41414141).
- CVE-2026-49427 requires largepage shm backing (via shm_open2, which is lethal). Regular shm sendfile+SF_NOCACHE only affects page cache hints, not page lifetime.

**Impact:** The sendfile code path is reachable on shm, but the UAF trigger (page freeing) does not fire on regular (non-largepage) shm objects. CVE-2026-49427 is not exploitable without shm_open2.

---

## Finding 85: ftruncate(0) on shm Zeroes Mapped Pages (probe 57k)

**Probe:** 57k

After `ftruncate(shm_fd, 0)`:
- The existing mmap mapping reads as 0x00000000 (was 0xAAAAAAAA before truncation).
- No SIGBUS or crash — the kernel replaces backing pages with zero-fill.
- Subsequent operations on the stale mapping (ftruncate back to size + second mmap + write) caused process hang/timeout in further probes (57m).

**Impact:** The kernel handles shm truncation gracefully by providing zero-fill demand pages. The mapping is not left dangling (no UAF). The hang on re-truncation suggests the VM system gets into a conflicted state when the old mapping + new backing overlap, which may warrant further investigation.

---

## Finding 86: kqueue Works, kevent at Syscall 363 (probes 57k, 57o, 57p) ★★★

**Probes:** 57k, 57o, 57p

Previous tests (phase 2) reported kqueue as "fd allocates but kevent returns -1". The issue was using the **wrong syscall number**: kevent is at syscall **363** (FreeBSD original), not 560.

Working kqueue event filters:
| Filter | Syscall | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| EVFILT_USER (-12) | 363 | **WORKS** | Self-trigger with NOTE_TRIGGER, udata preserved |
| EVFILT_READ (-1) | 363 | **WORKS** | Detected 4 bytes on socketpair (ident=24, data=4) |
| EVFILT_WRITE (-2) | 363 | Registered | No immediate event on unconnected socket |
| EVFILT_VNODE (-4) | 363 | **DEAD** | EINVAL on shm fd (probe 58a corrected this — 57p was false positive) |
| EVFILT_PROC (-5) | 363 | Registered | Process monitoring on self |
| EVFILT_SIGNAL (-6) | 363 | Registered | Signal monitoring |
| EVFILT_TIMER (-3) | 363 | **BLOCKED** | EV_ERROR errno=1 (EPERM) |

Timing: 5 kevent user-trigger cycles in 2.3ms (~473 μs/cycle). sys624 counter delta=10 across 10 kevent calls.

**Impact:** kqueue/kevent provides event-driven I/O monitoring, process event monitoring, and signal monitoring. EVFILT_VNODE is dead on shm (corrected by 58a). EVFILT_TIMER is permission-blocked but os.clock() provides timing. This is a major new primitive for socket state monitoring, side-channel timing, and potentially race condition exploitation.

---

## Finding 87: Additional Syscall Status (probes 57d, 57e, 57k)

**Probes:** 57d, 57e, 57k

| Syscall | Number | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| pipe2 | 542 | ret=-1 | Not working (fds=0,0) |
| madvise | 75 | ret=0 | MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE both succeed but don't visibly free pages |
| mincore | 78 | ret=0 | Page residency query works |
| fspacectl | 580 | ret=-1 | Dead |
| procctl | 544 | ret=-1 | All commands 0-20 return -1 |
| execve | 59 | ret=-1 | Returns error with invalid path (safe, not lethal) |
| ktrace | 45 | **LETHAL** | Process killed on call |
| socketpair | 135 | ret=0 | AF_UNIX works (fds 23,24) — confirmed from probe 46d |

## Finding 88: EVFILT_VNODE on shm Returns EINVAL (probe 58a)

**Probes:** 58a

EVFILT_VNODE registration on a shm fd returns EV_ERROR with errno=22 (EINVAL) for ALL note flags individually tested: NOTE_DELETE, NOTE_WRITE, NOTE_EXTEND, NOTE_ATTRIB, NOTE_LINK, NOTE_RENAME, NOTE_REVOKE.

shm fds do not support vnode monitoring on PS5 14.10. The earlier Finding 86 claim that "EVFILT_VNODE works on shm" was a false positive — probe 57p did not decode EV_ERROR in the output events. Corrected.

## Finding 89: CClosure Gadget Dispatch Confirmed (probes 58b, 58d)

**Probes:** 58b, 58c, 58d

CClosure +0x20 redirect to arbitrary eboot gadgets confirmed working:
- **xor eax, eax; ret** (0x31 0xC0 0xC3) at eboot+0x471 — called 3 times stably, Lua sees 0 return values (nil). This is the safe "nop" gadget.
- **pop rbp; ret** at eboot+0x1A0037, **pop rax; ret** at eboot+0x992, **pop rsi; ret** at eboot+0xD77D found.
- **ret alone crashes**: rax contains garbage → Lua interprets as huge nresults count → crash.
- **NOT found** in 640KB scanned: pop rdi; ret, mov rax rdi; ret, mov eax edi; ret, syscall; ret.

C function addresses from CClosures cluster at eboot+0x1A5000-0x1B6000. The `print` and `error` C functions are in a separate module at 0x3_10CXXXXX (not eboot, not directly readable as code).

CClosure struct layout confirmed from rawequal dump:
```
+0x00: GCObject *next (GC chain)
+0x08: tt=6, marked, isC, nupvalues
+0x10: Table *env (environment)
+0x18: GCObject *gclist
+0x20: lua_CFunction f (C dispatch pointer) ★
+0x28+: upvalue data

## Finding 90: kqueue fd Lifecycle Races Clean (probe 59a)

10 attack vectors tested against kqueue knote lifecycle:

1. **EVFILT_READ on shm → EINVAL** — shm fds do NOT support EVFILT_READ (or EVFILT_VNODE). Only EVFILT_USER works for shm-based monitoring.
2. **Close monitored fd + poll** — kernel properly detaches knotes, returns only the unrelated EVFILT_USER event.
3. **8 kqueues on same fd** — all EVFILT_READ registrations fail (EINVAL on shm). Clean teardown.
4. **fd recycling (close+reopen=same fd#)** — confirmed fd 23 reuses. EV_DELETE on stale ident returns ENOENT. No confusion.
5. **Close kqueue with 4 pending EVFILT_USER events** — 3 rounds, all clean. sys624 delta=0.
6. **Nested kqueue-of-kqueue** — EVFILT_READ on kq_inner from kq_outer WORKS, returns data=1 (pending count). Close kq_inner → poll returns 0 (proper cleanup).
7. **50 rapid create/register/close cycles** — 0 anomalies, 0 crashes, 0 stale events. 0.087s total.
8. **EV_ONESHOT + close without drain** — 20 rounds, all clean. No double-free.
9. **EV_ADD+EV_DELETE in same changelist** — processed sequentially. DEL+ADD order returns EV_ERROR ENOENT on the DELETE.
10. **EVFILT_READ on RAW socket** — registers successfully. Socket close + poll returns 0 (clean).

**EVFILT_PROC self-monitoring registers** for NOTE_EXIT, NOTE_FORK, NOTE_EXEC on own PID. No events pending without actual process events.

**Conclusion:** kqueue knote lifecycle is robust in single-threaded use on 14.10. Note: threading IS available via thr_new(455) — see Finding 91. Kqueue races were later exhausted with child threads (271g-271i): 10,000+ races across 4 variants, 0 anomalies.

## Finding 91: thr_new(455) Thread Creation Works — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 383a, 56l, 271g, 272a

`thr_new(455)` starts a child thread with `start_func(arg)` where arg arrives in `rdi`. The `struct thr_param` is 0x38 bytes: `start_func(+0)`, `arg(+8)`, `stack_base(+0x10)`, `stack_size(+0x18)`, `child_tid(+0x30)`. Much simpler than `thr_create(430)`'s ucontext gates.

Child threads execute ROP chains on the stack with full 4-arg syscall control via gadgets: `pop_rax_ret(+0x992)`, `pop_rdi_ret(+0xC9DFE)`, `pop_rsi_ret(+0xD77D)`, `pop_rdx_ret(+0x3B02D7)`, `pop_rcx_ret(+0xE64)`. No `pop r8`/`r9` found in 4.6MB eboot — max 4 args.

Thread budget: 25/11/9 measured ceilings per loader (242a/244a/245a). Child threads need a fake TCB via `sysarch(SET_FSBASE=129, &fake_tcb)` for any failing syscall (384b).

**Impact:** Race conditions ARE possible. This supersedes all earlier "no threading" statements. The AIO double-free (Finding 92) uses two child threads.

## Finding 92: AIO aio_multi_delete TOCTOU Double-Free — RETRACTED 2026-10-28 (added 2026-10-23)

> **RETRACTED — the 65l pairs are double-STATUS, not double-free.**
> The delete path drops its lock only when the work item's in-flight flag is set,
> and the submit path that would set it is behind a boot tunable that never
> enables on 14.10. See `docs/AIO_GATE_14_10.md`. The text below is the
> historical record.

**Probes:** 65d-65l (development), **65l** (confirmation)

Two child threads calling `aio_multi_delete` (syscall 662) concurrently on the same polled ID array produce kernel double-frees: **65 out of 480 IDs freed by BOTH threads** across 30 iterations. 26 of 30 iterations hit (87% per-iteration, ~13.5% per-ID).

The vulnerability: 662 iterates an array of AIO request IDs. For each ID it acquires the AIO queue lock, looks up the request, **drops the lock** to free sub-objects, then re-acquires. A second thread enters during the gap and frees the same sub-objects → double-free.

**Prerequisites discovered through 65d-65l iteration:**
- Submit via individual 669 calls (count=1 each) — batch submit only creates one request
- Poll each ID via 664 before delete — unpolled requests return `0x80020010`
- **Never call 670 (AIO init)** — permanently poisons the 662 delete path
- Two child threads via thr_new(455) — both must run at native speed
- 662 works without sysarch (no errno/`%fs` touch)

This is the vulnerability described by Jose Coixao, patched in firmware 14.20 with a post-lock-drop generation revalidation. It is the first confirmed kernel memory corruption primitive on 14.10.

**Impact:** Kernel double-free = potential heap spray → type confusion → kernel R/W → KASLR defeat → hypervisor bypass. See `docs/AIO_DOUBLE_FREE_14_10.md`.

## Finding 93: W^X Enforced at Hypervisor Level — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 423a, 424a-424c, 124a

`mprotect` accepts exactly the values with bit 2 (EXEC) clear — bit 0x4 is the only one refused (423a, 32768 of 65536 tested). `mmap` with `prot=0x7` maps a writable page but a child jumping to it faults on its first instruction (424a-424c). `sys 588` (dmem page attribute modify) returns 0 with `prot=RWX` but `sys 547` shows protection UNCHANGED (still 0x3 = RW), and executing shellcode on the "modified" page kills the process (124a).

**Conclusion:** The hypervisor enforces W^X below the kernel — the PTE never gets the execute bit. All kernel-level permission handlers are dead for code execution. Code exec must use ROP/gadgets exclusively.

---

## Finding 94: Child Thread Multi-Arg and Fake TCB — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 384b, 386a

Child threads can make syscalls with up to 4 controlled arguments: getpid(0-arg)=pid, write(3-arg)=8 bytes via socketpair, socketpair(4-arg)=ret 0 with fds created. sysctl(6-arg) fails EFAULT because r8/r9 are NOT zeroed at child entry and no `mov r8`/`xor r8d` gadgets exist in 4.6MB eboot.

The `fn_addr` stub error path accesses `%fs:0` for errno — a child without TLS crashes on ANY failing syscall. Fix: prepend `sysarch(SET_FSBASE=129, &fake_tcb)` to child ROP chain. Fake TCB = 4KB self-referencing pointer buffer. After fix, `close(-1)` returns -1 normally (384b).

---

## Finding 95: Concurrent Child Races Clean — added 2026-10-23

**Probes:** 385a, 410a-422b

Double-close (100 iter), UMTX trylock (50×4), socket write+close (50 iter) — zero kernel pointers, zero anomalies, zero corruption. fd table lock solid. Seven native-speed races (AIO submit/cancel, fstat vs close, kevent vs close, 500 close/open cycles, semaphore races) all clean. Object lifetimes hold at native speed on 14.10.

The only exception is the AIO multi_delete race (Finding 92), which exploits a lock-drop window in 662's iteration loop, not a missing lock.

---

## Finding 91: `dynlib_dlsym` (591) Fails for All 39 Loaded Modules (probes 512a, 513a)

`592(list, 0x100, count)` returns `ret=0` with `count=39` handles, and `593` resolves every one of
them to a text base, so the handle space is real. `591` then returns `-1` for **all 39 handles** with
the output pointer untouched (`0xDEADBEEF`), and the same for 4- and 6-argument call shapes, for a
NULL name, for a NULL out pointer, and for the three names `sceKernelGetProcessId`, `syscall` and
`getpid`.

The 13.60 decode (`docs/OFFLINE_HANDLER_DECODE_2026-10-23.md:44-64`) makes `591` ungated apart from
caller-module attribution: it resolves the caller's module, looks the handle up in the dynlib table,
passes the module's dynamic-link context to the symbol resolver and writes the result through the out
pointer. `-1` is what the libkernel syscall stub returns for every handler error, so the failing
check, or a new 14.10 gate, cannot be told apart without an errno.

Two limits on the negative result: the symbol argument here is a *name*, and Sony exports are looked
up by NID string, so a correctly formed NID could still succeed where these names fail; and the
failing call was made from Lua, not from a module that imports libkernel, so caller-module
attribution may reject it regardless.

Handles observed: `0, 0x2001, 2, 0x11, 0x13, 0x14, 0x22, 0x31-0x38, 0x3A, 0x3D, 0x40-0x42, 0x48,
0x4A, 0x4C, 0x4E, 0x51, 0x52, 0x7E, 0x81, 0x82, 0x8D, 0x8E, 0x9F, 0xA0, 0xA2, 0x20BD, 0x21F4,
0x1F6, 0x1FA, 0x1FB`. Captures: `results/phase17_new_vectors/512a_dlsym_handles_20261024_133938.txt`,

## Finding 92: The Caller-Set Contested Bit Reaches the umtx PI Path (probes 543a, 543b)

`_umtx_op` (454) takes a user pointer to a `struct umutex` whose first word is
the owner. The top bit of that word, `UMUTEX_CONTESTED` (0x80000000), tells the
kernel the mutex is contended, and the low bits are the owner thread id - both
supplied by the caller.

On 14.10 the kernel believes it.

`probes/phase17_new_vectors/543a_umtx_contested_bit.lua` writes
`0x80000000` (contested, owner 0), flags 0, and calls op 5:

| step | word before | return | word after |
|---|---|---|---|
| lock | `80000000` | 0 | `80018E6B` |
| unlock | `80018E6B` | 0 | `00000000` |

The lock succeeds and the owner becomes our own TID (`0x18E6B`) with the
contested bit preserved. The mutex is then usable normally.

`probes/phase17_new_vectors/543b_umtx_contested_owner.lua` writes
`0x80000001` (contested, owner 1 - a thread id nothing owns) and calls the same
op 5. **The call never returns.** The script prints the word, then the
connection idles until the harness timeout, and the loader stops answering
subsequent connections while the console stays up: the calling thread is asleep
inside `do_lock_umutex`, waiting for an owner that does not exist. A game
relaunch is required, as with the aio table wedge.

Two facts follow.

1. A caller-chosen 32-bit owner is resolved through the kernel's contention
   machinery. The owner is not validated against the calling process before it
   is used to find a thread.
2. The reachable primitive is at least a permanent block of the calling thread:
   `word = 0x80000001`, then any `_umtx_op(5)` call, and that thread is gone.

The PI path behind this is `do_lock_umutex` (op 5 body `0x37fd70` in the 13.60
capture) and its helpers inside `0x37fa90`-`0x381a10`; `UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT`
(flags 0x10) is accepted (`542a`), and `UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT` (flags 0x20)
leaves the owner word at `0x80000011` after a successful unlock instead of
clearing it.

What is **not** established: that the blocked owner can be made to disappear,
that the `umtx_pi` object allocated for the wait outlives its owner, or any
memory-safety consequence. The next experiment needs two threads: one owning a
PI mutex, one blocked on it, and the owner exiting without unlocking, which is
the lifetime race the public umtx fixes describe.

## Finding 93: A Dead Owner Leaves the Mutex Locked, and the Kernel Tolerates It (probes 545a, 546a, 547a)

**The owner thread can exit while holding a PI mutex, and the mutex stays
locked forever.** `probes/phase17_new_vectors/545a_umtx_dead_owner_wake.lua`
has a raw child take a mutex (op 5, flags 0x10), sleep
100 ms, and call `thr_exit` (431). `0x10` is `UMUTEX_ROBUST`, not
`UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT`; Finding 94 re-runs the same shape with the real PI flag.
The parent then measures:

| step | observation |
|---|---|
| child took the mutex | owner word `00018F42` |
| `thr_kill(tid, 0)` after the delay | `-1` - the thread is gone |
| op 3 (wake) | `ret=0`, word unchanged |
| op 18 (mutex wake) | `ret=0`, word unchanged |
| op 22 (mutex wake2) | `-1`, word unchanged |
| op 6 (unlock) from a non-owner | `-1`, word unchanged |

So the thread really exited, the kernel does not clear the userland owner word
(it cannot - it is user memory), and every wake-shaped operation answers
cleanly without touching it. The mutex is unusable for the life of the memory,
and a later op 5 on it blocks forever (544a, which wedged the loader thread).

This is a durable denial of service, not memory corruption: no wake operation
crashes, and the dead thread's ownership record is not left reachable in a way
that any tested call can touch.

**Non-block create ignores the item count.** `546a` calls
`669(flags=1, count=4)` and gets one id (`0x4205`); the derived ids
`base + i*0x10000` all poll `0x80020003` (object missing). Only block mode
(flags `0x1001`) creates one entry per item, and that is why `528a` could
delete four ids in one call. The earlier statement that all items of a
non-block create share one `0x30` context was wrong: there is only ever one
item, and one context, and deleting it frees that context while nothing else
references it.

**`aio_get_data` (665) is a stub.** `547a` calls it with four argument shapes
against a live completed id and after a delete; every call returns `-1` and
leaves the output page untouched. The 13.60 body is three instructions
(`push rbp; mov rbp,rsp; xor esi,esi; pop rbp; jmp 0x265760`), the same
return-error thunk used by 661 (`aio_submit`) and 668 (`aio_create`). The aio
family that actually runs is 662 delete, 663 wait, 664 poll, 666 cancel,
669 submit_cmd and 670 init.

Combined with Finding 92 and the delete path, the aio/umtx surface now reads:
both families have real code reachable from userland, both have windows that a
public fix describes, and neither has produced a memory-safety consequence that
can be turned into a read or write of kernel memory on this firmware.

## Finding 94: The Real PI Flag Works, and No Flag Disowns on Thread Exit (probes 564a, 565a, 567a, 569a, 570a)

**The lock routine reads the mutex flags from `[uaddr + 4]` and dispatches on
bits 2..3.** In `docs/dumps_13.60/kernel_text.bin` (base `0xffffffff8a9c0000`)
the shared lock routine at `0x8ad43ff0` copies the flag dword out with
`lea rdi,[rsi+4]` / `call 0x8ac194c0`, then runs `mov eax,0x202` /
`bextr eax,r13d,eax` and `jmp [rcx+rax*4]` through a table at `0x8be80728`,
which lies outside the captured text. Two bits select four handlers, so the
FreeBSD 11 constants are the ones that fit:
`UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT = 0x04`, `UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT = 0x08`,
`UMUTEX_ROBUST = 0x10`. Every earlier "PI" probe (`544a`, `545a`, `558a`)
wrote `0x10`, so they exercised a robust mutex, not priority inheritance.

**With the correct flag the contention path is visibly active.**
`probes/phase17_new_vectors/564a_pi_real_flag.lua` (flags `0x04`) locks and
unlocks uncontended (`ret=0`, word `00018F61`, then `00000000`).
`probes/phase17_new_vectors/565a_pi_waiter_handoff.lua` then has a waiter
block in op 5 behind the owner: the owner word becomes **`80018E6F`**, the
`UMUTEX_CONTESTED` bit set by the kernel itself. A control run with flags `0`
and a robust run with `0x10`
(`probes/phase17_new_vectors/567a_robust_owner_exit.lua`, word `80018E5B`)
produce the same shape.

**No flag disowns when the owner thread exits.** In every variant the owner
sleeps and calls `thr_exit` (431) while a waiter is queued; the word stays
`80018E6F` for 600 ms, the waiter never takes over, and the process survives.
`probes/phase17_new_vectors/569a_pi_dead_owner_churn.lua` then creates and
retires 48 threads to reuse the dead slot and has a third thread lock the same
address: the word still does not move, nothing faults. Rescue by writing zero
and op 3 wake still clears it.

**The child really does exit.** `thr_kill(tid, 0)` (432) answers `-1` for live
threads too, so it cannot serve as a liveness oracle. Instead
`probes/phase17_new_vectors/570a_child_liveness.lua` gives the child eight
fresh PI mutexes and one lock each with a 60 ms gap; op 5 writes the owner word,
so the parent counts progress:

| t | owned | first word |
|---|---|---|
| +60 ms | 2/8 | `00019071` |
| +180 ms | 4/8 | `00019071` |
| +420 ms | 8/8 | `00019071` |
| +720 ms | 8/8 | `00019071` |

The child reached the end of its chain and stopped; a child that faulted would
have ended the whole process, as `549a` did. Its tid appears in all eight
words and none is ever released.

So a PI or robust mutex whose owner exits while it holds the lock is stuck for
the life of that memory, its `umtx_pi` is not torn down, and the dead owner's
thread record stays referenced. Nothing in the tested surface turns the stale
reference into a fault: 48 reused thread slots and a fresh waiter on the same
address all run clean. It is a durable denial of service on one user address,
not a reachable UAF.

## Finding 95: A Writable Page Still Cannot Execute, Tested Through the Working Redirect (probe 572a)

**`mtypeprotect` (585) reports success and the page stays readable, but jumping
to it faults.** `probes/phase17_new_vectors/572a_cclosure_exec_page.lua` maps
four anonymous pages (`mmap(0, 0x4000, 3, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0)`), writes
`xor eax,eax; ret` (`31 C0 C3`) at offset zero and a store-and-return stub at
`+0x40`, then calls `mtypeprotect(page, 0x4000, 7)` and
`mtypeprotect(page, 0x4000, 3, 7)`; both return `1` and the bytes read back
intact. The CClosure object behind `rawequal` (`tostring(rawequal)` →
`function: 310f37820`, so the object address is the number after the colon)
has its `+0x20` function pointer replaced with the page, and `rawequal(1, 2)`
is called.

| step | result |
|---|---|
| `mmap` | ok, page `3111FC000` |
| `mtypeprotect(7)` / `(3,7)` | `rv=1` both |
| bytes at page | `31 C0 C3` |
| `rawequal` closure / fn | `13169293344` / `0x20F1E770` |
| redirect to the page, call | **no return value, process gone** (IDLE_TIMEOUT, loader dead) |

The same redirect to an eboot `xor eax,eax; ret` executes and returns cleanly
(probe 56d2), so the redirect mechanism is not the faulting part: the writable
page simply never becomes executable. That closes the W^X question that 44a
left open, because 44a reached its page through `fn_addr`, which 45c showed
does not drive execution.

**Probe-authoring note:** `tostring` on a C function prints `function: <hex>`
without a `0x` prefix, so an address pattern must be `": ([0-9a-fA-F]+)$"`.
A pattern that requires `0x` or digits-only silently yields `nil`.

## Finding 96: sceKernelMapDirectMemory Crashes Due to Heap Collision, Bypassed by mmap+dmem0 (probes 544a-545h)

**sceKernelMapDirectMemory (libkernel+0x15020) is 6-arg, not 7.** Signature:
`sceKernelMapDirectMemory(void **addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, off_t phys_addr, size_t alignment)`.
Confirmed via Apollo loader source (`gpu.lua:360`) and successful calls returning rv=0.

**AllocateDirectMemory (libkernel+0x17EF0) works from main thread** via
`native.fcall_with_rax`. Returns phys addresses in the GPU pool
(0x100000000-0x150000000). `GetDirectMemorySize` returns `0x150000000`.
Alignment must be >= 0x4000; smaller values return 0x80020016.
First 256MB of pool returns 0x80020023 (already allocated by the system).

**MapDM crash root cause (probes 544c-545c):** when `*virt_out=0` the kernel
chooses a random virtual address. This VA sometimes falls on the process heap
where Lua userdatas, the native handler chain, and fcall_stub structures live.
The new mapping REPLACES those heap pages, corrupting all C-level Lua objects.
Pure Lua (print, math, string) survives; any C function (memory.*, native.*,
make_syscall) crashes with the 0x1337 signal handler dump.

The crash is ASLR-dependent (~70% crash rate). Probe 545c proved the root cause:
MapDM with an invalid phys addr (0xDEADBEEF) returns rv=0 and `memory.read_dword`
works fine afterward — no real mapping is created, so no collision.

Setting a hint address (`*virt_out=0x880000000`) does not help: the kernel
ignores the hint and still places the mapping at a random VA (545b, 545d).
Apollo flags (prot=0x33, MAP_NO_COALESCE=0x400000) do not fix it (544t).

**BREAKTHROUGH (probe 545h):** standard `mmap(477)` with a `/dev/dmem0` fd
gives full R/W at a controlled virtual address, bypassing sceKernelMapDirectMemory
entirely:

```
1. AllocateDirectMemory(0, 0x150000000, 0x4000, 0x4000, 0, &phys)  → phys=0x110010000
2. open("/dev/dmem0", O_RDWR)                                       → fd=23
3. mmap(0x880000000, 0x4000, 0x33, MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED, fd, phys)  → rv=0x880000000
4. write_dword(0x880000000, 0xBEEFCAFE) + read_dword                → 0xBEEFCAFE ✓
```

Raw syscall 628 (mmap_dmem) returns -1 for the same parameters — the standard
mmap(477) path handles dmem0 fd correctly while the Sony-specific 628 refuses.

**Physical memory access is limited to the GPU direct memory pool
(0x100000000-0x150000000).** Kernel RAM lives in system RAM (phys < 0x100000000)
which dmem0 cannot reach — the offset is unsigned and the device pager verifies
allocation ownership.

> **Correction (Finding 103).** The pager does not reject a low offset: it accepts
> **any** 0x4000-aligned offset below 0x118000000, including everything below
> 0x100000000. What it returns there is not system RAM — a mapped low page is

> 0x100000 in one process reads back zero in the next. The conclusion (no kernel RAM

> ownership check on the allocation. This provides a reliable GPU memory R/W primitive but not
a kernel memory access path.

## Finding 97: `626` command 6 returns four live counters, and two of the published rows are stale (probes 796a-796d, 797a)

Most of this is already in `docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md`. Its section "Nothing written
through 625 is observable" (probes 538a, 539a) records that "sys 626's direct
read block accepts only command 5 with domain 0 and index 0..3 and reads
`0xc0010241 + 2*index`", and that every such read returns 0. Probe 796a measures
exactly that. What is new here is command 6, and the exact gate.

Two older rows contradict that section and are wrong: `ATTACK_SURFACE.md`'s
summary table ("Sony sys 626 (RDMSR) | ret=-1 for all 11 MSR indices, 3 arg
layouts (probe 54k, 2026-10-18)") and its follow-up note on 180a-182a ("626
returned -1 for 1270 shapes"). Those probes passed an MSR number as argument 1.
Argument 1 is a **command**, argument 3 is the index, and the MSR number is
computed by the kernel.

Measured on 14.10 (`results/phase17_new_vectors/796a-796d_*.txt`):

| call | result |
|---|---|
| `626(1..4, 0, 0, out, 0)` | `-1` |
| `626(5, 0, idx, out, 0)`, idx 0..3 | `0`, eight bytes written |
| `626(5, ...)`, idx 4..8 | `-1` |
| `626(5, 1, 0, out, 0)` | `-1` — arg2 must be 0 |
| `626(5, 0, 0, NULL, 0)` or `arg5=1` | `-1` |
| `626(5, 0, 0, unmapped, 0)` | `-1` — it is a real copyout |
| `626(6, 0, 0, p4, p5)` | `0`, **four counters per page**, both pointers required |
| `626(6, ...)`, idx != 0 or arg2 != 0 | `-1` |

`626` command 6 writes four 32-bit values at offsets `0, 8, 0x10, 0x18` of each
page, and they increase between calls in step with wall time
(`405E7113 -> 405ED0DA -> 46DC0497`), i.e. they are live cycle counters, not
addresses. Command 5 reads one counter, index 0..3.

`sys 625` is the sibling (`0x603c90`, narg 4). Probe 797a walked commands 1..0x17
and 21..23 with `arg2 = 0, arg3 = 0, arg4 = page`: every one returns `-1` except
**18, 19, 20**, which return `0` and **write nothing** — `arg4` is ignored
entirely (NULL and unmapped both give `0`). That is not a full walk: 180a already
records that commands 0x0D..0x10 return `0` when `arg2` is 1, 2 or 3, so the
`arg2 = 0` sweep could not see them. Its neighbouring block performs four `wrmsr` over
`0xc0010230..0xc0010238` with `and eax, 0xffbf0000`, so the family is the
performance-monitor block, not a general MSR interface.

What this establishes, and what it does not:

- A userland syscall executes `rdmsr` and copies the raw result to a user
  pointer. The MSR number is bounded by a small table, so `LSTAR`, `GS_BASE`,
  `EFER` and friends are **not** reachable.
- The values are live performance counters (they advance with time and differ
  per call), so this is **not** a KASLR source and not a memory primitive.
- `sys 567` (`0x6039d0`, narg 3) is in the same block: argument 1 is a TID
  (`thr_lookup`), argument 2 must be `<= 5`, and the thread must be the caller
  and in states `[thr+0x380]==1`, `[thr+0x400]==4`; it then reads
  `0xc0010201`. It is a per-thread counter query.

The value of the finding is the bound: the family is reachable, but only for
the performance block, and only through a kernel-computed MSR number. The
registered reads are counters, so nothing here is a KASLR source or a memory
primitive.

## Finding 98: The Hypervisor Call Opcode Is Not in Any Readable Executable User Page (probe 798a)

The kernel text holds 34 `vmmcall` trampolines between `0xc16a19` and
`0xc1720d` (kernel base `0xffffffff8a9c0000`), each shaped `mov eax,<id>;
vmmcall; ret`, plus two Intel `vmcall` (`0f 01 c1`) sites at `0xcb8562` and
`0xcb8605`. `VMMCALL` is not a privileged instruction on AMD: the hypervisor
intercepts it from any CPL, so if the opcode were reachable from user code a
ring-3 call into Sony's hypervisor would be possible with attacker registers.

It is not reachable, for two separate reasons:

- **No opcode in user text.** `probes/phase17_new_vectors/798a_vmmcall_bytes.lua`
  scans every region sys 674 reports with the executable bit, for
  `0F 01 D9/D8/DA/DB/DC/DD`. The `.executable` region (eboot, prot 5,
  `0x4CD70000`-`0x4D204000` in that run) yields two byte-pattern coincidences
  that are not instructions (`vmsave` at `0x4CEF885C` followed by `48 0F 48`,
  `stgi` at `0x4D162317` followed by `0F B0 0F`); `libc.prx` (prot 5) yields
  none. Every other system module is exec-only and unreadable, so its text
  cannot be searched.
- **No syscall forwards to a trampoline.** Every `call` whose target lands in
  the trampoline window was enumerated: 49 sites, all in kernel-initialisation
  or device code, none inside a handler that passes a user argument through.

The practical consequence is that the hypervisor path needs a writable and
executable page, which is exactly the `mprotect`/`W^X` wall already recorded;
`VMMCALL` from this process is not a shortcut around it.

## Finding 99: Two More Object Tables Are Not Reachable With One Argument (probes 799a, 800a)

Two subsystems looked promising from the 13.60 handler bodies and are closed
by measurement on the running console.

**`549` is osem and `558` is namedobj, so their ids do not cross.** The
assignment is already published: `549-556` is osem and `557/558` is namedobj
(`docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md:107-108`), and osem's slot order on 14.10 is
`(name, attributes, initial, maximum)`. Probe 799a passed that order, so `549`
copied the name with a 0x20 bound, allocated a 0x60 object, initialised it
through `0x8b5d55a0(obj, flags, a3, a4)`, registered it with
`0x8ad598e0([proc+0xc48])` and returned the handle in the **return value**
(`0xA207`, `0xC21D`, `0xC21E`, `0xC21F`, then `0xE205` for a repeated name,
i.e. one object per name). `558` is the *namedobj* destroy: it looks the id up
in the namedobj table, removes it and frees `[obj]` and `obj`. An osem handle
therefore returns `-1` from `558`, and so do `0`, `0x7fffffff` and
`0x12345678` - the class check master records at `docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md:469`,
not an unreachable table. The destroy route for these handles is `550`
(Finding 102), not `558`.

**fd release (`541`, `552`).** Both bodies decrement a reference count
(`[obj+0x50]` and `[obj+0x54]`) and free at zero, with a valid fd as the only
gate. On the console both return `-1` for a live socketpair end (fd `126`),
for fd `0`, and for an out-of-range fd. Whatever table `0x8ad59e20` is indexing,
this process does not reach it through these numbers.

The surviving rule is the same one the aio work produced: a Sony handler that
looks reachable from its disassembly is not reachable until its own lookup
returns something, and the lookup is where every one of these paths ends.

## Finding 100: The Module-Info Copyouts Reject an Oversized Length (probe 801a)

Both module-info calls copy a fixed kernel struct whose length the caller supplies, so
a length larger than the struct would have returned adjacent kernel memory. It does
not. `593(handle, buf)` with `[buf+0] = 0x2000` returns `-1` for handle `0`, whereas
the recorded `0x160` succeeds: the size field is validated, not trusted. `649(handle,
member, buf, 0x2000, 0, 0)` returns `0` for members 1-4, 7 and 8 on every one of the
39 handles from `592` and leaves the page bounded — no byte past the records and no
`0xFFFF8xxx` qword anywhere in the 0x2000-byte page (`probes/phase17_new_vectors/
801a_oversized_copyout.lua`, capture `results/phase17_new_vectors/
801a_oversized_copyout_20261026_111134.txt`).

Together with Finding 84 (the 9984-call 649 sweep) and Finding 85's null result for
593's fields, the whole module-introspection surface is closed as a leak source.

## Finding 101: The exec bit cannot be restored: `mmap` sanitises the protection and `max_protection` keeps it sanitised (probes 803c-803i)

`docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md` already records the *behaviour* ("`mmap` | RW only —
PROT_EXEC always stripped") and phase 3 recorded that `mprotect(EXEC)` always
fails. Probes 803c-803i show the *mechanism*, and the mechanism rules out every
variant of the idea, including the syscall-548 bypass that looked promising on
paper.

**548 is a batch VM API.** The handler at 13.60 offset `0xabbe60` takes
`uap[0]` (ignored), `uap[8]` (must be 0), `uap[0x10]` = array of 0x20-byte
records, `uap[0x18]` = a signed count. Record layout: `+0x00` qword address,
`+0x08` qword payload, `+0x10` qword length, `+0x18` byte prot, `+0x1c` dword op.
Measured op map:

| op | behaviour | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `-1` always (capability gates at `0x8b47bff3`: `[proc+0x1c9]>=2`, `[proc+0x464]&2==0`, `[proc+0x5d4]>=0x2500000`) | 803d |
| 1 | unmap — `region=GONE`, `ret=0` | 803d |
| 2 | **protect** — calls `0xffffffff8ac8bdb0`, which is `vm_map_protect` (locks `[map+0x170]`, bumps `[map+0x1c0]`, clamps to `[map+0x20]`/`[map+0x28]`, `lookup_entry`, per-entry `0x8ac8b4e0`) | 803d/803e |
| 3 | anonymous map — payload is ignored, `len` must be a multiple of `0x4000`, returns the address | 803f |
| 4 | `-1` always | 803d |

**`mmap` (477) clears the X bit before the mapping exists.** With flags
`0x1012`, one page per requested protection, the stored protection read back
from sys 674 is:

| requested | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 0x30 | 0x31 | 0x32 | 0x33 | 0x34 | 0x35 | 0x36 | 0x37 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stored | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | **0** | **1** | **3** | **3** | 0x30 | 0x31 | 0x33 | 0x33 | **0x30** | **0x31** | **0x33** | **0x33** |

Bit 2 (X) is always cleared, bit 3 is always cleared, and a request for write
implies read. The same holds with kernel-chosen addresses (`flags=0x1002`).

**`max_protection` is exactly the stored creation protection.** 548 op 2 on a
fresh RW page: `want 1 → 1`, `want 2 → 3`, `want 3 → 3`, and `want 4/5/6/7 →
-1`. On an existing `prot=5` text page (eboot `.executable`, `libc.prx`):
`want 3 → -1`, `want 5 → 0`, `want 7 → -1`. On a `prot=3` heap page:
`want 3 → 0`, `want 5 → -1`, `want 7 → -1`.

So the wall is a **VM-layer invariant**, not a syscall filter: the kernel never
creates a mapping whose `max_protection` includes a right the mapping did not
start with. This is stronger than stock FreeBSD, where `flags2maxprot` gives
`mmap(RW)` a max of RWX precisely so that a later `mprotect(RWX)` is legal —
the classic FreeBSD W^X bypass does not apply here.

**File-backed mappings are refused outright.** With valid read-only fds on
`/savedata0/thread.lua` and `/savedata0/main.lua` (opened by sys 5, fds 22 and
23), all twenty `prot × flags` combinations (`0x1002`/`0x1001`, prot
3/5/7/0x33/0x37) return `-1`. Syscall 477 is anonymous-only in this loader, so
there is no executable-file mapping to inherit an X-capable `max_protection`
from.

**Consequence.** No attacker-supplied byte can ever be executed: every route to
memory the game controls (477, 74, 548 op 2, 548 op 3) yields a mapping with
`max_protection` ⊆ {R,W}, and every route to executable memory refused the W
right. The 13.60 `vmmcall` trampolines (Finding 96) stay unreachable for the
same reason — they need a writable-and-executable page to place the call.

## Finding 102: `osem` works, and `ATTACK_SURFACE.md` says it does not (probe 804a)

This is a correction to the attack-surface table, not a new capability. Two
existing documents disagree: `docs/OBJECT_TABLE_14_10.md` records that
`549(name, 0x100, 0, 4)` creates and `551(name)` opens (probe 439a), while
`docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md` lists "Sony sys 549-556 (osem) | `osem_create` returns
`-1` for eight scalar shapes and for a NUL-terminated name pointer in either
slot" (probes 252a/253a). Probe 804a sides with `OBJECT_TABLE_14_10.md`: `549`
creates, `550` deletes, and the id follows the same `slot | generation << 13`
rule that 437a/440a already document for this table. The eight scalar shapes of
252a/253a simply never passed a name where the create wants one.

`549(nameptr, flags, arg3, count)` allocates a 0x60-byte object, initialises it
from a 0x20-byte user buffer and returns an id; `550(id)` looks the id up,
removes the entry and frees. The create in probe 804a returned `0x4205` (slot
0x205), `0x206`, `0x6205` (slot 0x205 again, generation 3), and a stale `0x4205`
issued against the live `0x6205` returns `-1` while the live id still deletes
with `0`. A second delete of a removed id also returns `-1`. `551` returns `-1`
for a live id.

The generation check is therefore present here as it is in the aio table (561a
measured the same rule there), and the 549/550 lifecycle is clean. The
attack-surface row should be replaced.

## Finding 103: The `/dev/dmem0` aperture is GPU bus space, not system RAM (probes 806a-809a)

**Claim.** `mmap(/dev/dmem0, va, 0x4000, PROT_RW, MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED, fd, phys)` accepts
**any 0x4000-aligned physical offset**, returns the requested address, and two mappings of
one offset alias each other. What it does *not* do is expose the kernel's physical memory,
which is what would make it a jailbreak primitive.

**Nothing here is new except the acceptance rule and the persistence test.** Finding 96
already records that dmem0 reaches only the GPU pool, and open PR #159 reports a 16 GB
scan of the same aperture. Two differences matter. First, the acceptance rule is
**alignment only** — there is no ownership check on the offset, which is what Finding
96's correction now says. Second, the top bound does not agree: PR #159 puts the pool
boundary at `0x150000000` and reports 100% rejection above it, while on this console
`0x120000000` and `0x140000000` are refused, so my window ends below `0x118000000`.
The persistence test (809a/810c) is the part neither earlier result had, and it is what
rules the aperture out: a shared COW view of system RAM would keep the kernel's bytes
readable even if writes were private, and the low pages instead read back as fresh zeros
in the next process.

**Measured.**

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| 806a | `phys` 0, `0x100000`, `0x100000000`, `0x110000000` map; `0x1000` and `0x100001000` → `-1`; `0x120000000` and `0x140000000` → `-1`. The only check is **0x4000 alignment**, and success returns the requested VA, not 0. |
| 806c | Two VAs over one phys alias: write `0xDEADBEEF` at VA1+0x40 → read back at VA2+0x40; reverse direction also aliases. |
| 806d | `[0,0x20000000)` at 0x4000 step: 32768 pages mapped, **13 non-zero** (`0` = `80000000C0012800`, `0x14000` = `0000000200000002`, `0x10014000`-`0x10028000` structured, `0x10D80000`/`0x11600000`/`0x11E80000`/`0x12700000` = `AFAFAFAF…`). A write at `0x100000` persisted **inside that process**. |
| 808c | `[0x20000000,0x80000000)`: 8192 mapped / 24576 holes per 128 MB and **zero non-zero pages** in 1.5 GB. The 1-in-4 ratio is only the 0x1000 probe step against the 0x4000 alignment. |
| 806d | `[0x100000000,0x120000000)`: 16388 pages, all zero. |
| 808a | Page 0 = GPU register; `0x1001000`-`0x1003000` are **unmappable holes**; `0x10018000` carries `@rbShdr`-shaped bytes and `0x1001C000`/`0x10024000` continue as an ELF section-header table — a device image, not the kernel. |
| 809a | The `A5A5A5A5` marker a **previous process** wrote at `0x100000` reads **zero** in a new process, while `0x10014000`, `0x10018000` and the `AFAFAFAF` pages at `0x10D80000` are **byte-identical across the restart**. |

**Reading.** A mapping operation that validates only alignment and returns aliasing views of
one offset is a device aperture. The restart test separates a real physical page from a
private one: the page we wrote was not preserved, the device pages were. Two models fit the
data — a demand-zero GART window where a write allocates a private page, or real pages that
the OS sanitises when the owning process exits — and the measurements do not distinguish
them. **Neither model yields the kernel image:** 1.5 GB above 512 MB and 512 MB of the pool
window are entirely zero, and the only non-zero content in the low 512 MB is a device image
and allocator fill.

**Why this matters.** `mmap` of `/dev/dmem0` was the last unchecked route to physical memory,
and physical memory is the one place Sony's VM-layer `max_protection` rule (Finding 99) does
not apply. It is closed for kernel access. What remains is a real but narrow capability:
arbitrary 0x4000-aligned *device* offsets can be mapped, aliased and written, which reaches
GPU firmware and the pool manager's free fill and nothing else.

**Harness limits.** A large mapping (32 MB, probe 807a) **succeeds** and then faults fatally
when a hole inside it is read; `808c` shows the holes are real. Only per-page 0x4000 mappings
fail cleanly. Scanning physical memory from Lua is also self-defeating: probe 808d's 268 M
reads starved the loader for a whole process lifetime.

## Finding 104: `sigreturn` (417) Installs a Caller-Supplied Register Frame, Cookie is RFLAGS (probes 813a, 814a, 814b, 2026-10-26)

**This was tried before and explained by nobody.** Probe 106a
(`probes/phase17_new_vectors/106a_sigreturn_srop.lua`) called 417 twice on
2026-10-21 with hand-built frames in two layouts; both returned `-1` and the
probe recorded nothing else
(`results/phase17_new_vectors/106a_sigreturn_srop_20261021_212215.txt`), while
`docs/PROBE_INDEX.md:2119` still lists 106a as "PREPARED — NOT RUN", in a row
whose own description reads "Two ucontext layouts tested", so the index
contradicts itself. The frames it built left RFLAGS at 0, so the cookie below
rejected them. That `-1` was the cookie, not a dead syscall.

**What 421 returns.** `syscall 421` (`0xc37860`) zeroes a 0x500 stack buffer, calls
`0x8af1d900`, stores `[td+0x3b0]`/`[td+0x3b8]`, and copies **0x4c0 bytes** to the caller
(`copyout 0x8ac191d0`). The record is the sigreturn frame itself. Probe 814a in one process
(pid 157):

| offset | value | field |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0E0` | `0x0815794B5C` | RIP (inside libkernel) |
| `0x0E8` | `0x43` | CS — the *user* selector on this firmware |
| `0x0F0` | `0x202` | RFLAGS |
| `0x0F8` | `0x310648868` | RSP |
| `0x100` | `0x3B` | SS |
| `0x108` | `0x480` | the same word `thr_create` wants at `+0x108` |
| `0x110` | `0x10002` | the `+0x110` gate word |
| `0x118` | `0x20001` | the `+0x118` gate word |
| `0x048` | caller's RDI | first GP slot |

So the "userland context" used by `thr_create`, by 421/422 and by sigreturn is one structure,
and 421 will hand a live copy of it to any caller.

**Why the 813a frames were rejected.** 417 (`0xa07280`, narg 1) `copyin`s 0x500 bytes to
`rbx+0xa0` and then tests, with `rbx = user - 0xa0`:

- `[rbx+0x170] < 8` → user `0x0D0` must be below 8;
- `([rbx+0x190] ^ [[td+0x460]+0xf8]) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFDAB22A == 0` → user `0x0F0` must match
  the live frame word at `+0xf8`;
- `[rbx+0x188] & 3 == 3` → user `0x0E8`, the CS;
- `[rbx+0x1b0] == 0x10000|0x10002` → user `0x110`;
- and at `0xa074c7` a further `[rbx+0x1b8] - 0x20001 < 2` → user `0x118`.

Probe 813a sent `0x0F0 = 0` and failed every time. The `0x4c0` record shows the word is
**RFLAGS = 0x202**, and `0x202 & 0xFFDAB22A = 0x202 ≠ 0`, so a zero cookie cannot pass. That
is the whole explanation for the three `-1` results.

**What the success path does** (offset `0xa0759a`, reached when the gates pass):
`bcopy(src=user+0x48, dst=[td+0x460], 0x90)` then `bcopy(src=user+0xD8, dst=[td+0x460]+0xe0,
0x30)` — `0x8ac19be0` is `bcopy(src=rdi, dst=rsi)`, proven by its `xchg rsi,rdi; rep movsq`
body. So the handler writes **0xC0 bytes of user data into the trapframe**, then
`[r13+0x40]=[user+0x480]`, `[r13+0x48]=[user+0x488]` (FS/GS base, `r13=[td+0x3f8]`),
`kern_sigprocmask(td, SIG_SETMASK=3, user, NULL, 0)` (`0x8af1d900` ORs/ANDs
`[td+0x3b0..0x3bc]` and masks `0xfffefeff`), and returns **`0xfffffffe` = EJUSTRETURN**.

**Measured.** Probe 814b took the kernel's own record and sent it straight back: `417 ret=0`,
and the process continued to the next statement. EJUSTRETURN tells the syscall return path to
skip storing `tf_rax`, so the frame's own RAX (zero in that record) is what Lua sees — the
`0` return is the frame's register, not an error code.

**The one privilege field, and it is closed.** The frame carries RIP, CS, RFLAGS, RSP and SS.
RFLAGS is the only field with a privilege meaning that survives a same-level `iretq`: IOPL,
which makes `cli`, `in` and `out` legal at CPL 3 and would be a route to device DMA. It cannot
be reached, and the reason is the shape of the check rather than a missing feature. The mask is
an *equality* test against the live frame, not a blacklist:

```
0x8b3c7326  mov rax, qword ptr [rbx + 0x190]   ; user 0x0F0 = the record's RFLAGS
0x8b3c732d  mov rdx, qword ptr [r15 + 0xf8]    ; the live trapframe's RFLAGS
0x8b3c7334  xor rdx, rax
0x8b3c7337  test rdx, -0x254dd6                ; sign-extended 0xFFFFFFFFFFDAB22A
0x8b3c733e  je   0x8b3c73b0                    ; must be zero on every masked bit
```

and the installer keeps the live value for exactly those bits:

```
0x8b3cacb9  mov r15, 0xffffffffffdab22a
0x8b3cacce  and r15, qword ptr [r12 + 0xf8]    ; bits inside the mask come from the live frame
0x8b3caea9  or  r15, r9                        ; r9 = user 0x0F0, bits outside the mask
0x8b3caf3d  mov qword ptr [r12 + 0xf8], r15
```

Bits 12 and 13 (IOPL) and bit 9 (IF) are **inside** the mask, so the user's copy is discarded
and the live value is installed; a user value that differs on any of them fails the `xor`.
Measured in 816a and 816c (`probes/phase17_new_vectors/816a_rflags_iopl.lua`,
`816c_frame_readback.lua`, captures `results/phase17_new_vectors/816[ac]_*_20261026_12*.txt`),
each row a fresh `421` with one bit changed:

| frame RFLAGS | bit | 417 |
|---|---|---|
| `0x000202` | none — the live value | accepted |
| `0x000242` | ZF 6 | accepted |
| `0x000282` | SF 7 | accepted |
| `0x000602` | DF 10 | accepted |
| `0x010202` | RF 16 | accepted |
| `0x000302` | TF 8 | accepted — **the process then single-steps and dies on `#DB`** |
| `0x001202` | IOPL 12 | **`-1`** |
| `0x003202` (816a) | IOPL 12-13 | **`-1`** |

The TF row is the positive control: the install is verbatim for bits outside the mask, so the
IOPL rejection is the cookie and not a broken path. A CPL-3 `iretq` is the only one available
and its live RFLAGS never has IOPL set, so the field is unreachable by construction. Only
persistent bits (TF, AC, RF, NT, IOPL) can be observed by reading the frame back — any
intervening instruction clobbers CF/PF/AF/ZF/SF/DF — which is why the table is read from the
417 verdict and the TF row rather than from readback values.

**422 is not a bypass.** `sys 422` (`0x8b5f7970`) copies the same `0x4c0` record in and calls
`0x8b3cac60` — the identical validator/installer — after its own copies of the `0x108 == 0x480`
and `0xD0 < 8` gates. There is no second, gate-free install path.

**And it is not an arbitrary write.** The destination is `[td+0x460]`, the calling thread's
own trapframe, and nothing in the path takes a pointer from user memory. A full 0x5a0 scan of
the 13.60 text for writes to `+0x460` found 30 sites, all on other structures; none reads a
user pointer into the frame slot (bg_15).
