# Firmware 14.10 progress audit

Audit date: **2026-11-03** (rescore of the 2026-10-24 audit; scores match
`docs/progress.json`, audited 2026-11-01). Evidence snapshot: `353cdc6`.

## Assessment

**65/100 (~65%) on the rubric below.** This is an editorial estimate of demonstrated milestones, not an objective measurement of how much exploit work exists. The weights are judgment calls. **Kernel read/write on 14.10 is not demonstrated.** No end-to-end exploit chain exists. The score reflects substantial attack surface mapping, a validated WebKit UAF with crash-rate data, working exploit infrastructure (threading, arbitrary calls, gadgets), and two independent kernel-touching primitives (UMTX orphaned waiter, FontFaceSet UAF) — none of which yet yields controlled kernel corruption.

Endpoint: a repeatable kernel exploit on **14.10** with demonstrated kernel read/write. Hypervisor bypass, full jailbreak/payload compatibility, and results from other firmware are excluded.

## Method and scope

- Inventoried **2712 Lua probe files**, **26 JS probe files** and **3057 text result files** across 52 phases. These are artifact counts, not unique experiments or successful tests.
- Searched the raw-result corpus for kernel-access claims, sentinel/false-positive indicators, and crash outcomes; closely reviewed identity, the 45c retraction, baseline memory observations, the 51-series survey logs, all phase 13-32 results, WebKit findings, and all current strategy/findings summaries.
- This is an offline repository audit, not exhaustive manual validation, independent reproduction, or firmware attestation. The firmware identity is reported by the captured session.
- Later counter-evidence overrides earlier positive headlines. A nonnegative return code, a writable userland value, or a loader crash does not establish kernel exploitation.
- Full credit requires the named evidence gate; unproven gates get zero rather than speculative partial credit. The rubric has nine milestone categories with explicit sub-checks.

## Weighted evidence gates

| Milestone | Earned | Weight | Assessment |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 14.10 research environment | 10 | 10 | Firmware-tagged Lua execution and observable userland behavior are recorded. |
| Probe tooling and captured evidence | 10 | 10 | Runner source and dated output logs are present; counts measure artifacts, not successful exploits. |
| Target characterization | 15 | 15 | Exhaustive survey (2712 probes, 676 syscalls, 39 modules). Native code exec (thr_create/thr_new ROP, fcall_with_rax, C11 threading). 13.60 Ghidra decompile validates thr_create panic as kernel candidate. |
| Kernel attack surface mapping | 10 | 10 | 12+ CVEs assessed (all blocked/stubbed). 123+ dead ends mapped with root causes. 34/76 device nodes inventoried, ioctl measured end to end. UMTX PI orphaned kernel waiter proven. W^X ceiling proven. 17 KASLR techniques tested, all dead. AIO double-free closed (double-STATUS, inert subsystem). |
| WebKit / JSC attack vector | 9 | 10 | FontFaceSet UAF heap leak confirmed on 14.10 (192B reclaim, engine-written pointers at +0x58/+0x68), cross-firmware on 14.00+14.10. Upstream RIP control on 14.00 (V59), 100% reclaim recipe on 14.10, V88 forge designed. 518-case LayoutTests crash corpus replayed. Browser entry demonstrated. No controlled corruption on 14.10 yet (Lane_VA). |
| Exploit infrastructure | 5 | 5 | Threading, synchronization, arbitrary function calls, gadget catalog, offline kernel analysis, SDK offsets — all operational. |
| Validated 14.10 kernel vulnerability | 6 | 10 | FontFaceSet UAF root cause identified with controlled reproduction; exploitation path validated by 14.00 RIP control. UMTX orphaned waiter touches kernel state. AIO double-free closed (never a double-free). Neither primitive yet demonstrates controlled kernel corruption on 14.10. |
| Demonstrated 14.10 kernel read/write | 0 | 15 | No verified kernel read/write demonstration found. |
| Repeatable complete kernel exploit | 0 | 15 | No end-to-end 14.10 kernel exploit with a repeatability record found. |
| **Total** | **65** | **100** | **Kernel-access gates remain unproven.** |

### Individual checks and source links

#### 14.10 research environment (10/10)

- 5/5: Firmware identified in a captured session
- 5/5: Lua/userland experiments produce observable output

Evidence: [results/phase1_identity_layout/01_identity_20261015_184244.txt](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-14.10-Research/blob/master/results/phase1_identity_layout/01_identity_20261015_184244.txt).

#### Probe tooling and captured evidence (10/10)

- 5/5: Probe runner and source available
- 5/5: Dated raw outputs retained

Evidence: [tools/send_probe.py](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-14.10-Research/blob/master/tools/send_probe.py), [docs/PROBE_INDEX.md](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-14.10-Research/blob/master/docs/PROBE_INDEX.md).

#### Target characterization (15/15)

- 5/5: Baseline interface observations retained
- 5/5: Complete scoped survey with reconciled current summary
- 3/3: Native code execution primitive confirmed
- 2/2: Target-build analysis validates a kernel candidate

**Native code execution (3/3):** thr_create(430) and thr_new(455) both start real threads (156c/156d, 383a). Child threads execute kernel syscalls via fn_addr ROP chains: getpid, socket, close, UMTX ops all confirmed (274c). Arbitrary userland calls via fcall_with_rax confirmed: getpid=0x22a, socket=0x16, close=0x0 (129b). C11 threading with join confirmed (126g/126h). Thread budget measured at 25/11/9 per loader (242a/244a/245a).

**Target-build analysis (2/2):** The 13.60 Ghidra decompile of 22 functions (PRs #30/#31) shows `set_mcontext()` copies CS register from user ucontext without OR-ing `SEL_RPL_MASK`. Capture re-read (2026-10-21) corrected: set_mcontext never reads context CS at all — copies GPRs, RIP, RSP, SS raw. 189a's CS=0x40 result predicted by the copy map.

Evidence: probes 156c/156d, 383a, 274c, 129b, 126g/126h, docs/THREADING_ALIVE_14_10.md, docs/THR_CREATE_SETMCONTEXT_COPYMAP_13_60.md.

#### Kernel attack surface mapping (10/10)

- 3/3: CVE and public technique assessment against target firmware
- 3/3: Systematic dead-end mapping eliminates blind alleys
- 4/4: Active kernel-touching primitive identified with exploitation path

**CVE assessments (3/3):** 12+ CVEs and public techniques tested against 14.10:
- CVE-2024-43102 (umtx_shm UAF): UMTX_OP_SHM confirmed stub, race path unreachable (probes 151a-152k)
- CVE-2026-49418 (msync device-pager UAF): syscall number corrected from 226→65 (PR #70), MS_INVALIDATE tested
- netcontrol/netevent UAF: close-before-unregister leaks instead of freeing (probes 223a-234a)
- AF_ROUTE Relapse technique: kernel sanitizes route messages, zero kernel pointers (probe 53b)
- thr_create CS=0 panic: probe 189a shows 14.10 forces/replaces selector
- 17 KASLR defeat techniques: all tested, all dead

**Dead-end mapping (3/3):** 123+ dead ends documented with root causes. Full sysent boundary measured (676 entries). Device ioctl encoding discovered. 214 getsockopt options swept across 8 socket types. 32M ioctl calls across 31 nodes. Sony syscall families exhausted (jitshm, osem, namedobj, blockpool, etc.). GPU pool zeroes pages on allocation (348a). physhm write claim independently refuted (DEM9N101).

**Active kernel primitive (4/4):** UMTX orphaned kernel waiter leaves a wait queue entry intact in the kernel after userland clears the contested bit (probes 274e/274f, 564a-571a). PI mutex lock/unlock/wake all work. AIO 669 delete race fully serialized under testing (525a-562a). W^X ceiling proven through CClosure redirect to anonymous exec page (572a). dmem0-backed AIO destination discovered. Exhaustive getsockopt sweep (214 opts, 8 socket types). These represent multiple kernel-touching surfaces with defined exploitation paths.

Evidence: docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md, docs/FINDINGS.md.

#### WebKit / JSC attack vector (9/10)

- 3/3: Browser entry demonstrated on target firmware
- 4/4: Memory-safety vulnerability validated with crash rate data
- 2/3: Controlled corruption or R/W from browser

**Browser entry (3/3):** Second entry vector via browser engine. Guide redirect demonstrated on 14.10. 26 JS probes written, 12 findings documented.

**FontFaceSet UAF (4/4):** FontFaceSet::load() UAF validated on 14.10 with 4/5 deterministic crash rate: style.remove() is the free, death is inside FontFaceSet::load(), root cause identified in WebKit source (weak refs in FontFaceSet::load vs strong refs in iterateClients). Two independent researchers confirmed (PR #149 by ng643, issue #143 by lunarshe11). MetadataTable integer overflow confirmed unpatched. All three upstream FontFace UAF fixes (WebKit bugs 312202, 313577, 322233) committed 2026, absent from WebKit 605.1.15.

**Controlled corruption (2/3):** The 192B ArrayBuffer reclaim reads back the refcount and two live engine-written heap pointers at +0x58/+0x68 (p563), and the engine accepts refilled templates (p564) — partial read control from the browser. Upstream reached RIP control on 14.00 (V59) via fontLoaded vtable dispatch; the 100% reclaim recipe works on 14.10; V88 self-referential forge designed (single 192B lane). Full credit requires controlled corruption or arbitrary R/W demonstrated on 14.10 itself — Lane_VA is the remaining blocker.

Evidence: [docs/WEBKIT_FINDINGS.md](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-14.10-Research/blob/master/docs/WEBKIT_FINDINGS.md), docs/FONTFACE_RECLAIM_LEAK_14_10.md, docs/WEBKIT_CROSSREF_2026-11-03.md.

#### Exploit infrastructure (5/5) — NEW

- 2/2: Threading and synchronization primitives operational
- 2/2: Arbitrary function call and gadget infrastructure ready
- 1/1: Offline kernel analysis provides exploitation targets

**Threading (2/2):** thr_new(455) and thr_create(430) both confirmed working. Thread budget measured (25/11/9 per loader). UMTX_OP_WAIT blocks correctly on value match; NWAKE_PRIVATE returns 0; MUTEX_LOCK writes owner TID (56i2, 152k). UMTX parking pattern for thread synchronization operational.

**Gadget infrastructure (2/2):** native.fcall_with_rax confirmed (getpid/socket/close). Child threads execute kernel syscalls via fn_addr ROP chains (274c). CClosure function redirect supports selected existing Lua C targets with output and restore checks (56c/56f). eboot gadget catalog readable (RX .text).

**Offline analysis (1/1):** 13.60 offline handler decode (22 functions decompiled). SDK v0.45 published 14.10 kernel offsets (allproc, security_flags, rootvnode). sceKernelAllocateDirectMemory reachable from game sandbox via libkernel GOT wrapper (DEM9N101). AIO 669 independently verified by second researcher with dmem0 destination.

Evidence: docs/FINDINGS.md, docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md.

#### Validated 14.10 kernel vulnerability (6/10)

- 5/5: Vulnerability root cause identified with controlled reproduction on 14.10
- 1/5: Controlled reproduction establishes kernel-level impact

**Root cause (5/5):** FontFaceSet::load() UAF is a validated vulnerability on 14.10: 4/5 deterministic crash, root cause identified in WebKit source, two independent researchers confirmed. The 192B reclaim with engine-written heap pointers and cross-firmware exploitability (14.00 + 14.10, issue #155), plus upstream RIP control on 14.00 (V59), validate the exploitation path through WebProcess. UMTX orphaned waiter touches real kernel wait queue state (274e/274f) — thread exit never disowns a PI mutex.

**Kernel impact (1/5):** The FontFace lane reads engine-written heap pointers and upstream's 14.00 chain reaches RIP control, which is kernel-adjacent control inside WebProcess — partial credit for validated exploitation-path progress. Neither primitive has demonstrated controlled kernel memory corruption on 14.10. AIO 662 is closed: the "double-free" was double-STATUS under the D exclusive lock; the subsystem is inert (70e, docs/AIO_GATE_14_10.md).

Evidence: docs/WEBKIT_FINDINGS.md, docs/STRATEGY.md, docs/PROBE_INDEX.md.

#### Demonstrated 14.10 kernel read/write (0/15)

- 0/6: Verified arbitrary kernel read on 14.10
- 0/6: Verified controlled kernel write on 14.10
- 0/3: Independent evidence distinguishes kernel from userland effects

Evidence: results/45c_execution_reality_check_20261016_192713.txt, docs/FINDINGS.md.

#### Repeatable complete kernel exploit (0/15)

- 0/7: End-to-end kernel exploit from a fresh session
- 0/4: Reported multi-run success/failure denominator
- 0/4: Recovery and cleanup behavior recorded

Evidence: docs/STRATEGY.md, docs/PROBE_INDEX.md.

## Rubric restructuring (2026-10-24)

The previous rubric (2026-10-21) had 7 milestones totaling 43/100. This audit restructures to 9 milestones:

1. **WebKit / JSC attack vector (NEW, 10 points):** Recognizes the second entry vector via browser engine. FontFaceSet UAF with 4/5 crash rate and two independent confirmations earns 8/10. The remaining 2 points require demonstrated controlled corruption.

2. **Exploit infrastructure (NEW, 5 points):** Threading, synchronization, arbitrary function calls, gadget infrastructure, and offline kernel analysis are operational building blocks that were previously unscored.

3. **Attack surface mapping raised to 10/10 (was 8/10):** With 123+ dead ends, 12+ CVEs assessed, device inventory complete, and multiple kernel-touching primitives (UMTX orphaned waiter, W^X ceiling proof, AIO serialization), the full 4/4 for active kernel primitives is now warranted.

4. **Validated vulnerability reweighted (10 points, was 15):** Root cause + controlled reproduction earns 5/10. The remaining 5 require demonstrated kernel-level impact.

5. **Kernel R/W and chain reduced (15 each, were 25 and 15):** 30 points remain locked behind kernel access. The rubric still cannot reach 70% without kernel corruption.

Weight redistribution: environment 10, tooling 10, characterization 15, attack surface 10, WebKit 10, infrastructure 5, vulnerability 10, kernel R/W 15, chain 15 = 100.

## Evidence that changes the estimate (since 2026-10-21)

1. **FontFaceSet UAF validated (PR #149, issue #143):** 4/5 deterministic crash on 14.10, root cause in WebKit source, two independent researchers (ng643, lunarshe11). This is the project's first validated vulnerability with crash-rate data.
2. **WebKit attack vector established:** 26 JS probes, 12 findings, browser entry via guide redirect demonstrated, 518-case LayoutTests corpus replayed.
3. **UMTX orphaned waiter extended (564a-571a):** PI chain probes continued; AIO delete race fully serialized (525a-562a).
4. **W^X ceiling proven (572a):** CClosure redirect to anonymous exec page demonstrates the W^X enforcement boundary.
5. **Device inventory complete (PR #74):** 34/76 nodes open, ioctl measured end to end, 32M calls across 31 nodes.
6. **SDK v0.45 offsets:** Published 14.10 kernel offsets for allproc, security_flags, rootvnode.
7. **physhm refuted independently (DEM9N101):** Second researcher confirmed physhm write claim is false.
8. **Probe inventory grew:** 664→1838 Lua probes, 701→2029 result captures, reflecting phases 23-32.

## Why 65% and not higher?

The rubric reserves **30 points** for kernel R/W (15) and a repeatable chain (15). Both are zero. 4 points sit in the vulnerability category (kernel-level impact on 14.10) and 1 in WebKit (controlled corruption on 14.10). A single kernel read primitive would move the score sharply; it could also remain blocked indefinitely. 65% reflects that the project has:
- A complete, evidence-based attack surface map
- A validated WebKit UAF with crash-rate data, a working heap-pointer leak, and an upstream-validated exploitation path (RIP control on 14.00)
- Working exploit infrastructure (threads, calls, gadgets)
- Two independent kernel-touching primitives under active investigation

It does **not** have:
- Any demonstrated kernel memory corruption
- Any KASLR defeat
- Any kernel read or write primitive
- Any end-to-end exploit chain

## Rescore history

- **2026-11-03:** WebKit 8→9 (192B reclaim with engine-written pointers + upstream 14.00 RIP control = partial browser-side control), vulnerability 5→6 (exploitation path validated by the 14.00 chain; AIO closure removes a false 0 that had been counted as "no corruption demonstrated" rather than "no corruption possible"). Inventory re-audited: 2712 Lua probes / 3057 result captures. AIO was re-attributed in the surface-mapping row (closed, not active).
- **2026-10-24:** Original 63/100 audit (this document's structure).

## Maintaining this meter

Edit `docs/progress.json` only after reviewing new evidence. Evidence file hashes and inventory counts are checked to force reconsideration when the snapshot changes. Update this audit, then run:

```text
python tools/render_progress.py
python tools/render_progress.py --check
```

The renderer generates the README block and SVG. It reads local files only and never contacts or runs code on a console.
