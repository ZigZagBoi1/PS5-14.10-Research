# PS5 Firmware 14.10 - Kernel Research

Open community kernel exploit research on PlayStation 5 firmware **14.10**, conducted via a userland Lua 5.1 loader on TCP 9026.

> **Goal:** Establish a reproducible 14.10 kernel primitive, then assess whether it can support kernel R/W and hypervisor research. None of those kernel-side stages is currently demonstrated.

**Current goal: $250 CAD** for the Claude Max 20x plan — a 1-million-token context window that can ingest the entire research corpus at once and find novel kernel vulnerabilities that smaller context windows miss.

**Current progress: $112.74 / $250 CAD**

### Why I need this

I've spent **two weeks** on this project — roughly 4 hours every weekday and 10-15 hours each weekend day. Here's what I've spent out of pocket so far:

| Expense | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Claude Pro subscription (maxed out) | $150 CAD |
| Claude API credits (maxed out) | $100 CAD |
| ChatGPT Plus / Codex accounts × 3 (all maxed) | ~$80 CAD |
| PS5 console for v13.60 kernel dumps | $450 CAD |
| **Total personal investment** | **~$780 CAD** |

I have a full-time job. I've exhausted my personal AI subscriptions and API credits. The research has produced **230 probes**, **247 result captures**, recorded **CClosure redirects to selected existing Lua C functions**, and the most comprehensive PS5 14.10 syscall surface map that exists publicly. But I've hit a wall: the examined paths have not established a kernel base on 14.10, and finding a novel one requires the kind of deep cross-referencing and creative analysis that only a large-context AI can do efficiently.

The $250 Claude Max 20x plan would give me enough resources to feed the **entire** research corpus (all probes, all results, all 13.60 kernel dumps, all documentation) into a single context and have it reason about novel exploit paths that no one has tried before. I'm confident this would be enough to find the kernel bug and get it working **before the GTA 6 release**.

**Every dollar helps.** This research stays open and free regardless of funding.

**Update 2026-10-18:** Target characterization raised from 5 to 10/15. Phase 14 (probes 54a-56k5) completed an exhaustive Sony syscall survey, confirmed CClosure +0x20 as a controlled dispatch primitive, mapped the full 317-region process VM, tested the documented KASLR candidates without establishing a kernel base, and analyzed 13.60 kernel dumps. The "complete scoped survey" gate is now earned. The "target-build kernel candidate" gate remains unearned (no 14.10 kernel image available).
<!-- RESEARCH_PROGRESS:END -->

## Current Status: KASLR Wall

**At this time, I am unable to find a v14.10 kernel exploit.** The saved tests have not established a kernel base through the examined paths. Negative or incomplete results do not establish that every information leak is patched or every KASLR technique is impossible. The confirmed userland primitives (CClosure redirect, heap R/W, syscall invocation) are powerful but cannot reach the kernel without knowing where it is.

### Recorded outcomes for tested KASLR candidates

| KASLR Technique | Result | Probe |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| AF_ROUTE kernel pointer leak (Relapse) | Sanitized — zero kernel pointers | 53b |
| mincore/msync/madvise oracle | Lethal — instantly kills process | 56k |
| Timing side-channel via CClosure redirect | SMAP — no differentiation between mapped/unmapped | 56j |
| Signal handler fault recovery oracle | Handler bypasses pcall, no in-process oracle | 56k2, 56k3 |
| RDMSR (sys 626, 567) | Returns -1 for all MSR indices | 54k |
| kldstat/kldnext (sys 307, 308) | Lethal — instantly kills process | 56k4, 56k5 |
| mod* syscalls (sys 300-302) | All return -1 | 56k5 |
| kldsym (sys 337) | Never reached (kldnext kills first) | 56k4 |
| sysctl kernel pointer scan | All values are sentinels, not pointers | multiple |
| sys 674 VM map (317 regions) | All userland VA, zero kernel pointers | 55e, 55f |
| sys 649 module members | Userland addresses only | 54k |
| kinfo_proc full dump | Only sentinels (0xFFFFFFFF_*) | multiple |
| net.route.iflistl scan | sockaddr/MAC structures, no kernel pointers | 54f |
| sys 593 deep struct scan | NID hashes, not kernel pointers | 54f |
| sys 639/638 memory region | Returns -1 for all address ranges | 54f |
| sys 588 (13.60 exploit path) | No-op on 14.10 | 54d |
| AIO (sys 661-670, 13.60 exploit path) | Lethal — sys 661 instantly kills process | 54c, 54f |

### What IS working (strong userland primitives)

| Primitive | Status | Probe |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CClosure +0x20 redirect | Selected existing Lua C functions returned target-like results and were restored; arbitrary target/ABI support remains unverified | 56c, 56f |
| Heap R/W (256+ pages) | GPU mmap adjacency, no guard pages | 41c |
| Arbitrary syscall invocation | make_syscall(N) for tested numbers | 41w |
| Userland ASLR bypass (39 modules) | dynlib_get_info(593) | 41o |
| Full process VM map (317 regions) | sys 674 with protections and names | 55e |
| Signal handler install | sigaction(416) returns 0 | 56k |
| Network packet injection | RAW socket + IP_HDRINCL | 34-39 |
| sys 624 VM operation counter | +5 per mmap, zero jitter, monotonic | 52b |

The older `fn_addr`/ROP execution interpretation is withdrawn for the tested 45c path. It is distinct from the later CClosure observations. See the [ledger guide](docs/RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.md), [existing evidence audit](docs/EVIDENCE_AUDIT_2026-10-17.md), and [independent audit snapshot](docs/INDEPENDENT_EVIDENCE_AUDIT_2026-10-17.md).

## Key Constraints

- **W^X enforced** - `mmap(RWX)` gives RW only; `mprotect(EXEC)` always fails
- **Execute-only memory (XOM)** - system lib .text is XO (reading crashes); eboot is RX
- **No threading** - `fork`, `rfork`, and `thr_new` were blocked or crashed in tested paths
- **AIO — confirmed hard wall** - sys 661 instantly kills the process on 14.10
- **kldstat/kldnext — confirmed hard wall** - sys 307/308 instantly kill the process
- **Per-connection ASLR** - fresh process per TCP connection
- **SMAP enforced** - no timing differentiation between mapped/unmapped kernel VA
- **No kernel pointers found** - extensive scanning across every accessible interface
- **AF_ROUTE KASLR (Relapse technique) — confirmed dead** - kernel sanitizes route messages
- **RDMSR blocked** - sys 626 and sys 567 return -1 for all MSR indices
- **/dev/dmem0** - GPU aperture only, cannot access CPU/kernel physical memory

## Use AI to Help

All research data is in this repo specifically so anyone can feed it to their AI model of choice. For the best results, use a model with the largest possible context window.

**For maximum-context models (1M+ tokens):**
- Feed `docs/ALL_RESULTS.md` + `docs/ALL_PROBES.md` + `CLAUDE.md` — this is the entire research corpus in three files
- Ask the model to find novel KASLR defeat paths that haven't been tried
- Ask it to cross-reference 13.60 kernel dumps against 14.10 behavior

**For smaller context models:**
1. Start with `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for the full picture
2. Feed it `docs/STRATEGY.md` for what's been tried and what's next
3. Feed it `docs/FINDINGS.md` for all technical findings
4. Point it at specific probe results in `results/` for raw data analysis

**What we need help with most:**
- **KASLR evidence** — the examined paths have not established a kernel base. CClosure results support selected existing Lua C targets; extending that to other targets or a kernel disclosure remains a hypothesis.
- **13.60 → 14.10 kernel diff analysis** — the companion repo has 13.60 kernel dumps. Finding what changed between versions could reveal new attack surface.
- **FreeBSD r230171 source analysis** — find exploitable code paths reachable from our ~40 working syscalls
- **Loader internals reverse engineering** — the Lua loader's C-level syscall dispatch may have writable function pointers

The more models looking at this data from different angles, the faster we find a kernel primitive.

## Related V13.60 Research

The companion [PS5 V13.60 Research](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-V13.60-Research) repository maintains the firmware 13.60 Relapse and Byepervisor-Reborn research, its local browser site, and observed stage evidence. This V14.10 project retains `docs/ps5_13.60_sysent.json` for existing strategy and probe tooling; the source copy and attribution are maintained in the companion repository. Relapse's 13.60 support does not imply support on 14.10.

## Userland Entry

The exploit chain uses **Hamidashi Creative** (a Japanese visual novel on the Artemis/Lua engine) as the entry point. A modified save file embeds the Lua loader, which starts a TCP listener on port 9026.

- **Game:** Hamidashi Creative (はみだしクリエイティブ) - free demo on Japanese PSN
- **Loader:** Based on [shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader)
- **Kernel offsets:** From [@hammer-83](https://github.com/hammer-83)'s [ps5-jar-loader](https://github.com/hammer-83/ps5-jar-loader) (fw 1.00–10.01 only - 14.10 offsets TBD)
