# PS5 Scene Research - October 2026

## Executive Summary

As of October 18, 2026, **no public kernel exploit exists for PS5 firmware 14.xx**. The latest exploitable firmware is **13.60**, served by the Relapse exploit chain (ntfargo) and the Byepervisor-Reborn hypervisor exploit (ChendoChap). Relapse is not supported above 13.60. Byepervisor-Reborn ships offsets for 13.60/13.20/13.00 (untested) only, and its README states the bug "could work on 14.00 as well" with modifications — so 14.00/14.10 patch status is **unresolved**, not confirmed. However, several 2026 FreeBSD kernel CVEs look promising for 14.10 research.

> **Update 2026-10-19** — see [§6](#6-update-2026-10-19) for what changed since
> this document was written and for the retracted Byepervisor patch claim.

## 1. Current PS5 Exploit Landscape

### Relapse (ntfargo) - Firmware 7.00-13.60
- **Published:** September 29, 2026 on GitHub
- **Author:** Nathan Fargo (ntfargo)
- **Chain:** WebKit JSC structured-clone object-pool mismatch -> kernel aio_multi_wait UAF race
- **Kernel bug:** A flaw in `aio_multi_wait` where new wait modes allow double-linking of AIO requests, causing a use-after-free. The UAF gives a controlled decrement at an arbitrary kernel address, used to corrupt a `pipe_buffer` descriptor for kernel R/W.
- **KASLR defeat:** Uses AF_ROUTE RTM_GET socket to leak kernel addresses (confirmed patched on 14.10 per our probe 42b)
- **Status:** Tethered (RAM-only, lost on reboot). Unreliable (~30% success rate on kernel stage). Can hang/panic.
- **Firmware 14.00+:** NOT supported by Relapse. The author ships 7.00-13.60 only and does not claim higher. That is a statement about the exploit's coverage, not an independent patch confirmation; this repo has no 14.10 result for the `aio_multi_wait` entry (see [§6](#6-update-2026-10-19)).

### Byepervisor-Reborn (ChendoChap) - Firmware 6.xx-13.60
- **Published:** October 12, 2026 on GitHub (PS5Dev org)
- **Author:** ChendoChap (implementation), TheFloW (original discovery), Jordy (independent discovery)
- **Bug:** S3 resume (rest mode wake) vulnerability. The `startup_mp` hypercall brings up CPU cores 1-15 under an insecure nested page table configuration. This lets an attacker with kernel execution remap hypervisor memory.
- **What it gives:** Hypervisor memory access, disables execute-only protection on kernel pages, enables kernel dump and patching.
- **Status:** Developer proof-of-concept only. No HEN, no FPKG loader, no patches included.
- **Firmware 14.00+:** **Unresolved.** The repo README says: "With modifications, it could work on 14.00 as well, but this is not provided here, especially since there is no public 14.00 kernel exploit anyways." The earlier "Patched. The rest-mode resume path was hardened." line had no primary source and is retracted in [§6](#6-update-2026-10-19).

### PS5 BootROM Key Leak (Jan 2026)
- **Date:** December 31, 2025 / January 2026
- **What:** BootROM key hex strings leaked on Discord and psdevwiki
- **Impact:** Unpatchable via software. Would require hardware revision. But does NOT give an immediate jailbreak by itself - still needs a runtime exploit chain.
- **Current status:** No public exploit using these keys. One researcher claimed a FW 12.00 exploit using Star Wars: Racer Revenge (CUSA-03474) + keys, but no code released.

## 3. FreeBSD Kernel CVEs (2025-2026) - Potential PS5 Applicability

These are all LOCAL privilege escalation bugs in recent FreeBSD. The PS5 runs a modified FreeBSD kernel (r230171). The key question for each is whether the vulnerable code path exists in the PS5's fork.

### REQUIRES PS5-SPECIFIC EVIDENCE

**CVE-2026-58083 - kqueue fork-copy UAF**
- Published: August 19, 2026
- Bug: Use-after-free in kqueue's fork-copy routine, triggered by timer-based knotes
- Impact: Kernel use-after-free with potential privilege escalation (per the FreeBSD CVE description); no PS5 impact is established.
- Upstream affected scope: FreeBSD 15.1-RELEASE before `p2`; do not transpose this range to Sony's kernel.
- PS5 relevance: **UNKNOWN**. Probes 20 and 21 show kqueue and timer-filter operations, but do not exercise copy-on-fork. Probe 27 records `fork`, `rfork`, and `thr_new` returning -1. The PS5 version string `r230171/releases/14.10` does not identify the corresponding upstream source or patch state. See [the PS5 14.10 assessment](../CVE-2026-58083-PS5-14.10.md).

**CVE-2026-49412 - IPV6_MSFILTER UAF**
- Bug: Lock released during copyin in IPv6 multicast source filter setsockopt
- Impact: Use-after-free, potential kernel R/W
- PS5 relevance: **HIGH** - PS5 has IPv6 support (confirmed by our probes). setsockopt is accessible via make_syscall. The lock-drop-during-copyin pattern is a classic exploitable primitive.
- Affected: FreeBSD 14.3, 14.4, 15.0
- Note: One source says no vendor fix was available as of late June 2026

**CVE-2026-7270 - execve operator precedence overflow**
- Published: April 30, 2026
- Bug: Operator-precedence bug causes buffer overflow in execve argument handling
- Impact: High severity, low attack complexity
- PS5 relevance: **UNCONFIRMED** - upstream FreeBSD facts are verified, but this repository has no authenticated 14.10 kernel code artifact proving the vulnerable expression, syscall reachability, or execution order relative to sandbox enforcement. See [the CVE-2026-7270 assessment](../CVE-2026-7270-ASSESSMENT.md).

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**CVE-2026-45258 - /dev/dsp mmap integer overflow**
- Bug: Integer overflow in sound device mmap lets crafted offset/length bypass size check
- Impact: Kernel memory R/W from any local user
- PS5 relevance: **MEDIUM** - PS5 has audio hardware but /dev/dsp may not be accessible from the sandbox. Worth testing if the device node exists.

**CVE-2026-49417 - /dev/dsp close-while-mapped UAF**
- Bug: UAF when sound device closed while buffer mapping remains
- PS5 relevance: **MEDIUM** - Same access question as above.

**CVE-2026-49419 - jail refcount underflow**
- Bug: Reference-count underflow in jail set/get paths frees in-use prison structure
- PS5 relevance: **UNRESOLVED, trigger surface unmeasured** - no probe or capture ever issues 338/429/496/497, and in the 13.60 dumps 338/496/497 sit at the nosys slot (only 429 has a body). The "may use jails" hypothesis has no call behind it. See the [evidence assessment](../CVE-2026-49419-PS5-14.10.md); reachability probe `57e_jail_reachability` is prepared, not run.

**CVE-2026-45257 - KTLS receive page cache overwrite**
- Bug: sendfile over loopback with KTLS overwrites page cache
- PS5 relevance: **LOW-MEDIUM** - Requires KTLS and loopback sendfile. Complex setup.

### LOWER PRIORITY

**CVE-2026-49416 - vt(4) CONS_HISTORY ioctl overflow**
- PS5 relevance: **LOW** - console driver ioctl, unlikely accessible from sandbox.

**CVE-2026-49414 - ELF ASLR disable for setuid PIE**
- PS5 relevance: **LOW** - Information leak, not direct escalation.

## 4. Implications for Firmware 14.10 Research

### What's Patched on 14.10
1. **AF_ROUTE RTM_GET KASLR leak** (Relapse technique) - confirmed dead by our probe 42b
2. **aio_multi_wait UAF** (Relapse kernel bug) - Relapse supports 7.00-13.60 only and its author does not claim 14.xx. In this repo the 14.10 entry (663) has no test result, and syscall 661 is lethal on 14.10 while it is a nosys stub in 13.60 — see [AIO_RANGE_14_10_EVIDENCE.md](../AIO_RANGE_14_10_EVIDENCE.md). Treat the 14.10 status as unmeasured, not patched.
3. **Byepervisor rest-mode HV bug** - **unresolved, previously overstated here.** The exploit author's README says the bug "could work on 14.00 as well" with modifications; no offset work exists. See [§6](#6-update-2026-10-19).
4. **AIO generally** - sandbox-killed at kernel level (may be separate from the UAF patch)

### What Might Still Work
1. **IPV6_MSFILTER setsockopt UAF (CVE-2026-49412)** - PS5 applicability is unresolved: option 74 was never issued, no multicast group was joined, and no second thread is available through any tested path; see the [evidence assessment](../CVE-2026-49412-PS5-14.10.md). Reachability probe `50e_ipv6_msfilter_reach` is prepared, not run.
2. **kqueue timer knote UAF (CVE-2026-58083)** - applicability is unknown. Timer filters work in a saved run, but the required copy-on-fork path is not demonstrated; see the [evidence assessment](../CVE-2026-58083-PS5-14.10.md).
3. **execve argument overflow (CVE-2026-7270)** - PS5 applicability is unconfirmed; see the source and evidence assessment. Do not treat pre-sandbox reachability as established.
4. **Sound device bugs (CVE-2026-45258, CVE-2026-49417)** - If /dev/dsp or equivalent is accessible.

### Recommended Next Probes

**Probe A: IPV6_MSFILTER setsockopt (CVE-2026-49412)**
- Create an IPv6 socket
- Call setsockopt with IPV6_MSFILTER
- Craft arguments to trigger the lock-drop-during-copyin window
- Reachability first: probe `50e_ipv6_msfilter_reach` (prepared, not run) issues option 74 and maps the handler's early checks; the race itself requires a second thread no tested path provides.

**Probe B: kqueue timer knotes (CVE-2026-58083)**
- Create a kqueue (already confirmed working for fd allocation)
- Register timer-based knotes via kevent
- Test if the knote timer path triggers the UAF without needing fork

**Probe C: execve argument parsing (CVE-2026-7270)**
- Status: superseded by the non-triggering source and evidence assessment in [CVE-2026-7270-ASSESSMENT.md](../CVE-2026-7270-ASSESSMENT.md).
- Do not run an oversized-argument trigger against the console as part of this probe plan. The repository lacks the authenticated 14.10 kernel code needed to establish applicability, and a runtime trigger would be a kernel privilege-escalation attempt.

**Probe D: Sound device access**
- Try to open /dev/dsp via make_syscall (open = syscall 5)
- If accessible, test mmap with crafted offset (CVE-2026-45258)

**Probe E: jail syscall access**
- Test jail_get/jail_set via make_syscall
- If accessible, attempt refcount underflow (CVE-2026-49419)

## 6. Update 2026-10-19

This section records what changed after the body above was written, and retracts
one unsupported claim.

### 6.1 Retraction: Byepervisor-Reborn is not "patched on 14.00/14.10"

The body of this document asserted that 14.00 and 14.10 patch both Relapse and
Byepervisor-Reborn. The Relapse half rests on the author's own supported range
(7.00-13.60). The Byepervisor half does not survive its own README, which says:

> "However this bug should technically be exploitable as low as 6.xx. With
> modifications, it could work on 14.00 as well, but this is not provided here,
> especially since there is no public 14.00 kernel exploit anyways."

That is a statement that the *offsets* are missing, not that the *bug* is
fixed. The two readings are not equivalent, and the repo had no primary source
for "the rest-mode resume path was hardened". The correct status is
**unresolved**.

### 6.2 What the exploit actually requires

From the shipped README and the accompanying writeup
(`soniciso1/ps5-hv-writeups`, `s3-resume-startup_mp-ap-launch.md`). **Every
address and offset below is read off the 13.60 firmware** — the writeup's only
binary — and none of it has been checked against 14.00 or 14.10:

| property | value | firmware |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | `HCALL 0x0f` (`khv_startup_mp`) | name only, no address |
| Handler | `0x105B0` | 13.60 |
| Window | S3 resume: `startup_mp` bitmap cleared, new `vcore_t.cur_npt == 0` (root 0 = host view) while APs boot | 13.60 |
| Guards | only `core < 16` and the one-shot bitmap | 13.60 |
| Launch used | `core=15`, RIP `0x3ffff000`, CR3 `0x68000`; carrier page executable under root 0 via firmware `bios_mapping` | 13.60 |
| Hypervisor PA (non-Pro) | `0x062800000` | 13.60 |
| Hypervisor PA (Pro) | `0x8E0800000` | 13.60 |
| VMCBs | 16 at `0x62a57000..0x62a75000`, `sizeof(vmcb_t)=0x1000` | 13.60 |
| Firmware support | 13.60, 13.20, 13.00 (untested); "exploitable as low as 6.xx" | author's claim |
| Precondition | "prior GameOS kernel read/write plus ROP or kernel-call capability" | author's claim |

The last row is the one that matters for this repo: the writeup calls it "a
boundary crossing after kernel compromise, not an unprivileged entry point."
Hypervisor access is **downstream** of kernel R/W, so no scene release changes
the ordering of work on 14.10. KASLR defeat and kernel R/W remain the gate, and
Byepervisor-Reborn would be the natural hypervisor step *after* that gate
opens, at the cost of a new offsets header and offsets for `kgadget()`,
`kdlsym()`, and `rawoff()`.

**What would settle the 14.x question.** Disassemble the `khv_startup_mp`
handler on a 14.10 kernel and compare three things against the 13.60 body: the
`core < 16` bound, the one-shot bitmap clear, and the nested-page-table root
loaded before the AP starts. Any of those changing is a patch; none changing
means the bug is intact and only the offsets are missing. This repository holds
no 14.10 kernel image and the committed dumps are 13.60, so the question stays
open here. Do not carry the addresses above into 14.10 work.

### 6.3 Timeline as of 2026-10-19

| date | event |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-17 | `ntfargo/Relapse-Exploit` created (MIT) |
| 2026-09-29 | Relapse public: 7.00-13.60, PS5 and PS5 Pro, tethered |
| 2026-10-02 | 14.10 (`26.06-14.10.00`) published; press reports "security fixes" without naming a component, so this is not evidence about the hypervisor path |
| 2026-10-12 | `PS5Dev/Byepervisor-Reborn` created |
| 2026-10-13 | Byepervisor-Reborn covered publicly: 6.xx-13.60, requires kernel R/W first |
| 2026-10-17 | Press coverage of this repository's 14.10 work (TwistedVoxel) |

No public kernel exploit for 14.00 or 14.10 is identified in any source
reviewed for this update. No source states that the hypervisor bug was fixed,
and the exploit's own README says the opposite for 14.00. Firmware 14.10
remains the newest line.
