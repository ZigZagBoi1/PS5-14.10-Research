# AFK Remote Control Setup (chiaki-ng → PS5)

Goal: full control of the PS5 from this PC (see screen + press controls) so the loader-restart workflow never requires being at the console again.

## Why chiaki-ng
- Streams the PS5 screen to this PC with full input (gamepad or keyboard-mapped buttons)
- Can wake the PS5 from rest mode over the network
- Official PS Remote Play (already installed, v9.5.0.08040) is the fallback, but it requires a real gamepad and cannot map keys — chiaki-ng is the AFK-automation client.

## One-time console step (~5 minutes at the TV, unavoidable once)
Remote Play pairing requires being at the console exactly once. After that, everything is remote.

1. **Relaunch Hamidashi Creative** — press PS button, close the game if running, reopen it. Wait for the black screen + the "remote lua loader ... listening on 9026" notification.
2. **Turn OFF auto-updates (CRITICAL — protects fw 14.10):** Settings → System → System Software → System Software Update and Settings → turn OFF "Download update files automatically" AND "Install update files automatically".
3. **Enable wake-from-network:** Settings → System → Power Saving → Features Available in Rest Mode → "Enable Turning On PS5 from Network" = ON, and "Keep Connected to the Internet" = ON.
4. **Get the pairing PIN:** Settings → System → Remote Play → Link Device → 8-digit code.
5. On the PC: launch chiaki-ng → log in to your PSN account when prompted (your credentials, entered by you) → Register this PS5 → enter the PIN from step 4.
6. chiaki-ng Settings → Controller/Key mapping → enable keyboard bindings (defaults work; adjust to taste). Optionally set the console for direct connection to 10.0.0.96.

## After setup — the AFK loop
- **Loader dies during a probe** (per-connection kills recover on their own; a whole-loader kill like probe 51a's syscall 561/562 hit needs a game relaunch):
  1. Watchdog flags it (or a probe returns 0 bytes / port 9026 refuses).
  2. Open chiaki-ng → connect to PS5.
  3. PS button → close game → reopen Hamidashi Creative → wait for the "remote lua loader" notification.
  4. Resume the probe queue (tools/run_session52.py).
- The screen stays visible from the PC the whole time — no TV, no couch trips.
- chiaki-ng ships a CLI (cli/ folder in its repo) — if it exposes session launch programmatically, the relaunch itself can be keystroke-scripted later.

## Install (PC)
Preferred: portable zip from https://github.com/chiaki-ng/chiaki-ng/releases (v1.10.0 or newer, "portable" Windows asset), extracted to a local folder — no admin needed. Fallback: winget install --id=StreetPea.chiaki-ng -e (may require permission approval).
