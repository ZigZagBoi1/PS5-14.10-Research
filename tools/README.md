# Tools

Utilities for sending probes to the PS5, reviewing saved output, and running network-side attack sessions.

## send_probe.py / send_probe.ps1

Sends one Lua probe script to the PS5 loader over TCP. The sender never retries
automatically. The Python sender supports `--timeout` as an idle read timeout
and `--total-timeout` as an optional wall-clock cap. `--save` mirrors probe
subdirectories below this checkout's `probes/` directory into `results/`.
Use `--metadata` with the Python sender to add a JSON sidecar containing the
transport status, elapsed time, probe hash, and target address; it also records
silent/reset runs as empty captures.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/send_probe.py --save --metadata --strict \
    probes/<phase>/<probe_name>.lua
```

Native PowerShell alternative:

```powershell
.\tools\send_probe.ps1 probes\<phase>\<probe_name>.lua -Save
```

The loader expects an 8-byte little-endian uint64 length prefix followed by raw
Lua source on TCP port 9026. Results are relative to the current working
directory. A timeout/reset is a transport outcome only; correlate it with
`tools/ps5_watchdog.py` before calling it a process kill or console reboot.

## run_probe_batch.py

Runs a bounded list sequentially. It stops at the first timeout, reset, refusal,
or silent close unless `--continue-on-failure` is explicitly supplied. It does
not relaunch the game or retry a probe, and `--save` writes a batch JSON
manifest.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/run_probe_batch.py --save --strict \
    probes/phase14_final_push/54o_cfunc_redirect_controlled.lua \
    probes/phase14_final_push/54p_redirect_minimal.lua
```

For the current redirect probes, run only after the game and loader have been
restarted. Keep `--continue-on-failure` off so a wedged session cannot cause a
second probe to be sent automatically.

## analyze_result.py

Reviews saved probe output locally, without connecting to a console:

```bash
python tools/analyze_result.py "results/*.txt"
```

Marked pointer lines use the same 64-bit value scan and address classifier as
ordinary data output. A buffer offset such as `kinfo+0x060` is not the pointer
value that follows it; marker text alone does not establish a kernel pointer.
The report remains heuristic: a candidate is not proof of a leak, and the
kernel-base/sysent estimates are not verified firmware 14.10 addresses.

## Regression tests

Run the hardware-free sender and analyzer regression suites:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py" -v
```

Sender tests exercise the actual Python and available PowerShell CLIs against a
local TCP loader; PowerShell cases are skipped when neither `powershell.exe`
nor `pwsh` is installed. Analyzer tests use temporary synthetic captures and
check the reported pointer values, counts, and false-positive cases. Neither
suite contacts a console.

## run_session40.py

PC-side raw-packet server for the TCP connect-back fuzz (probe 40). Impersonates a fake LAN host so the Windows stack doesn't RST the connection.

```bash
python tools/run_session40.py --ps5-ip 10.0.0.96 --fake-ip 10.0.0.250
```

Runs an ARP responder + raw packet sender from an unowned IP address. The PS5 connects back to the fake IP, then the script delivers malformed TCP segments through the established connection.

## tcp_fuzz_server.py

Standalone TCP fuzzing server for crafting and sending malformed TCP segments to the PS5.
