# PS5 Firmware 14.10 - Kernel Research

Open community kernel exploit research on PlayStation 5 firmware **14.10**. This project attacks the PS5 security stack from two directions: a **Lua 5.1 loader** (TCP 9026, via game save exploit) for direct kernel/syscall research, and a **WebKit/JSC crash corpus** targeting the console's browser engine. 2682 probes written, 3005 result captures, 170+ technical documents, 80+ merged PRs, 80+ documented dead ends, 52 research phases.

> **Goal:** Userland code execution -> kernel R/W -> hypervisor bypass. Kernel read/write on 14.10 is **not demonstrated**. The Lua loader gives us powerful userland primitives (threading, heap R/W, arbitrary function calls, syscall invocation). The Lua loader kernel attack surface is exhausted. WebKit Canvas UAF (CVE-2026-43720) is the only live vector — it needs a browser access mechanism and an alternative info leak.

## Attack Surface Overview

The PS5 security stack has multiple layers. This project researches all of them:

![PS5 Security Architecture](docs/images/architecture.svg)

### Entry Vector 1: Lua 5.1 Loader (Primary)

The game **Hamidashi Creative** (Artemis/Lua engine) loads a modified save file that starts a TCP listener on port 9026. We send Lua probe scripts over the network. This gives us:

- Direct memory read/write via `memory.*` API
- Syscall invocation via `make_syscall(N)` (bypasses Lua-side filter; kernel restrictions still apply)
- GPU mmap for large heap R/W (256+ pages, no guard pages)
- CClosure function pointer redirect for calling existing Lua C functions
- `native.fcall_with_rax` for arbitrary userland function calls
- Thread creation via `thr_create(430)` with full register control and `thr_new(455)` with arg delivery
- Child thread ROP syscalls (5-arg) via native gadget chains
- Per-connection ASLR (fresh process per TCP connection)

### Entry Vector 2: WebKit / JSC (Browser Engine)

The PS5's built-in browser runs a WebKit engine forked before Safari 17.0 (Sep 2023 branch, JIT disabled, LLInt only). This project maintains:

- **518-case JSC crash corpus** targeting WebKit bugs fixed after the Safari 17.0 branch (harvested by `tools/webkit_crash_corpus.py`)
- **17 browser probes** (phase13_webkit): MetadataTable overflow, engine fingerprint, capability map, crash oracle, corpus runner
- **Poly-proto OOM reproducer** (12 lines, exhausts WebProcess memory in ~1 second, PR #77)
- **p172 iframe runner** for executing crash cases on-console
- **WebKit canary battery** (11 probes testing Relapse scope-leak, popup isolation, etc.)
- Cross-reference with [pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research) for MetadataTable overflow (CVE-2026-64784) and CSSFontFace UAF (CVE-2026-43715)

Key WebKit findings: No WebAssembly, no SharedArrayBuffer, no WebGL. All 3 Relapse WebKit bugs patched. Popup isolation is dead (all methods kill WebProcess). **Canvas UAF (CVE-2026-43720) confirmed on 14.10** — write primitive claimed (p553), but `IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS` (info leak vehicle) is blocked. Canvas UAF probes p553-p563 target size-class scanning and alternative reclaim paths. Corpus has not been fully run on-console yet.

## Research progress

[![14.10 evidence-weighted milestone estimate: 63/100](docs/images/research_progress.svg)](docs/PROGRESS_AUDIT.md)

**63/100 (~63%) on a subjective, evidence-weighted milestone rubric.** (Score pending re-evaluation — AIO 662 vector closed Oct 27, 2026.) This is not a measured percentage of unknown exploit work, time remaining, or probability of success. **Kernel read/write on 14.10 is not demonstrated.** Hypervisor bypass is excluded from this score.

**Correction:** Probe 45c retracts earlier `fn_addr`/ROP execution and W^X-bypass claims. Those are not credited by this meter; historical diagrams and older findings are not current proof. 13.60 artifacts do not establish 14.10 exploitability.

## Confirmed Working Primitives

These are the tools we can use right now on 14.10:

| Primitive | How | Probe |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Thread ROP execution** | `thr_create(430)` with CS=0x43/SS=0x3B, full GP register control. Multi-gadget chains (pop rdi, pop rax, mov [rdi],eax;ret) confirmed. Thread wrote 0xDEADBEEF to controlled address. | 80a-80k, 156c/156d |
| **Arbitrary userland function calls** | `native.fcall_with_rax`: getpid=0x22a, socket=0x16, close=0x0 all correct | 129b |
| **C11 threading** | `Thrd_create` spawns 5+ concurrent threads with join. `Atomic_fetch_add_8` as entry verified. Budget: 8 children max. | 126g/126h, PR #71 |
| **Heap R/W (256+ pages)** | GPU mmap adjacency, no guard pages | 41c |
| **CClosure function redirect** | Selected existing Lua C targets (rawequal/rawget/type) produced target-like outputs with restore checks. Arbitrary target/ABI and ROP support remain unverified. | 56c/56f |
| **Raw syscall invocation** | `make_syscall(N)` for tested numbers. Bypasses Lua-side filter only; kernel restrictions apply. | multiple |
| **Userland ASLR bypass** | `dynlib_get_info(593)` returns base addresses for 39 userland modules. Kernel ASLR is separate. | 41o |
| **Full process VM map** | sys 674 returns 317 named regions with protections. All userland VA. | 55e/55f |
| **Network packet injection** | RAW socket + IP_HDRINCL, TCP connect-back with ARP responder | 34-39 |
| **sys 624 VM operation counter** | +5 per mmap, zero jitter, monotonic. Side channel for counting kernel VM ops. | 52b |
| **Device inventory** | 34 of 76 `/dev` nodes open from game process. ioctl(54) reaches all 34 drivers. | 259a-268a |
| **UMTX functional** | UMTX_OP_WAIT blocks on value match, NWAKE_PRIVATE returns 0, MUTEX_LOCK writes owner TID | 56i2, 152k |
| **POSIX shm (shm_open/ftruncate/mmap)** | shm_open(482) works: SHM_ANON, named objects, O_CREAT\|O_RDWR, ftruncate, mmap(MAP_SHARED). shm_open2(571) is nosys. | 391a-391d |
| **AllocateDirectMemory (GOT wrapper)** | `libkernel+0x17EF0` works from sandbox via GOT — rv=0, phys `0x110010000`+. GetDirectMemorySize returns `0x150000000` (5GB GPU pool). | DEM9N101 |
| **dmem0 mmap R/W (main thread)** | `open("/dev/dmem0")` + `mmap(477)` with MAP_SHARED\|MAP_FIXED maps allocated physical pages at controlled VA. Full R/W confirmed. Bypasses sceKernelMapDirectMemory crash. GPU pool only (0x100000000-0x150000000). | 545h |

---

## Hard Walls (What's Blocking Us)

| Wall | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No kernel pointers found** | 17+ KASLR techniques tested across every accessible interface. Zero kernel pointers. |
| **W^X enforced** | `mmap(RWX)` gives RW only. `mprotect(EXEC)` always fails. No bypass found. |
| **Execute-only memory (XOM)** | System lib .text is XO (reading crashes past pcall). Eboot .text is RX (readable). |
| **kldstat/kldnext lethal** | sys 307/308/337 instantly kill the process. Host-only syscalls in console kernel. |
| **AF_ROUTE sanitized** | Kernel zeroes all pointers in route messages. Relapse KASLR technique is dead on 14.10. |
| **RDMSR blocked** | sys 626 and sys 567 return -1 for all MSR indices. |
| **SMAP enforced** | No timing differentiation between mapped/unmapped kernel VA. |
| **fork/rfork blocked** | `thr_create(430)` and `thr_new(455)` both work. `fork`, `rfork` stay blocked. |
| **Sysent ends at 676** | 677+ all kill the process (thirty-one consecutive, reads as past-the-end). |
| **Device ioctls reject everything** | Sony uses NID-hash command codes, not FreeBSD `_IOC` encoding. 13.60 NIDs don't work on 14.10. |
| **Physical memory limited to GPU pool** | dmem0 mmap only reaches phys 0x100000000-0x150000000 (GPU direct memory). Kernel lives in system RAM (phys < 0x100000000), unreachable via any device fd we can open. Dense 16GB scan (547a-547g): 100% rejection above 5.25GB. dmem1/dmem2 expose the same pool. gc/dce/zero reject all offsets. AllocateDirectMemory only allocates within GPU pool. |
| **Sony syscalls exhausted** | All accessible Sony syscalls tested for kernel pointer leaks (548a). 596=no-op, 604=always -1, 559=boolean, 615/613=gated. Zero kernel pointers from any accessible Sony syscall. |
| **UMTX_OP_SHM stubbed** | All sub-ops return 0 but do nothing. CVE-2024-43102 is not exploitable on 14.10. |
| **netcontrol UAF dead** | Reference leak, not free. Public ExploitNetControlImpl precondition does not hold. |

### Tested KASLR Candidates (All Failed)

| Technique | Result | Probe |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| AF_ROUTE kernel pointer leak (Relapse) | Sanitized | 53b |
| mincore/msync/madvise oracle | Lethal | 56k |
| Timing side-channel via CClosure redirect | SMAP blocks | 56j |
| Signal handler fault recovery oracle | Handler bypasses pcall | 56k2/56k3 |
| RDMSR (sys 626, 567) | Returns -1 | 54k |
| kldstat/kldnext (sys 307, 308) | Lethal | 56k4/56k5 |
| mod* syscalls (sys 300-302) | Returns -1 | 56k5 |
| kldsym (sys 337) | Lethal | 171a |
| sysctl kernel pointer scan | All sentinels | multiple |
| sys 674 VM map (317 regions) | All userland VA | 55e/55f |
| sys 649 module members | Userland addresses only | 54k |
| kinfo_proc full dump | Only sentinels | multiple |
| net.route.iflistl scan | sockaddr/MAC, no pointers | 54f |
| sys 593 deep struct scan | NID hashes, not pointers | 54f |
| sys 639/638 memory region | Returns -1 | 54f |
| kern.proc.filedesc/vmmap | Blocked (ret=-1) | multiple |
| sys 588 (13.60 exploit path) | No-op on 14.10 | 54d |
| dmem0 16GB physical memory scan | GPU pool only (0-5.25GB), 100% reject above | 547a-547g |
| dmem1/dmem2/gc/dce/zero phys access | Same pool or reject | 547f |
| Sony sys 596/604/559/615/613 | All dead (no-op, -1, boolean, gated) | 548a |
| /dev/gc ioctl surface (32M calls) | Zero kernel pointers, 25 inert commands | 259a-268a |

## Current Priority Vectors

These are the active leads, ranked by potential:

### 1. Canvas getContext() Reentrancy UAF (CVE-2026-43720) — Community WebKit Chain

[pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research) has a WebKit chain at stages 5/8 confirmed: UAF trigger, same-type reclaim, alias R/W through 12 Canvas2D APIs, crash oracle, and APNG-based ASLR defeat. **Remaining:** arbitrary R/W (lineDash vector forge) and code exec (vtable hijack + ROP). **Current blocker:** live vtable offset on 14.10 is unknown (13.00 offset ruled out, [issue #47](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research/issues/47)). Key PS5 properties: IsoHeap OFF, Gigacage DISABLED, JSC Config unfrozen (instant type confusion with arb write), JIT disabled (LLInt only). Our Canvas UAF probe (p550) targets the same CVE from the Lua side.

### 2. WebKit FontFaceSet UAF (CVE-2026-43715)

FontFaceSet::load() UAF validated on 14.10 with 4/5 deterministic crash rate. Root cause: weak refs in FontFaceSet::load vs strong refs in iterateClients. Two independent researchers confirmed (PR #149, issue #143). Next: same-size class substitution with shapeable field + address disclosure. Our Lua primitives may contribute the addr-leak side.

### 3. JSC crash corpus (518 cases)

Post-Safari-17.0 regression tests targeting WebKit bugs the PS5 browser engine predates. Even one crash is a lead. Corpus generated by `webkit_crash_corpus.py` (PR #75). p172 iframe runner is built. Not yet fully run on-console.

### 4. fd-close/sendmsg race via child thread

Use thr_new ROP child to close(fd) simultaneously with main thread sendmsg(SCM_RIGHTS, fd). 20 iterations clean (534e), but larger runs may hit the race window. Low confidence but mechanically sound.

### 5. UMTX PI orphaned waiter escalation

Thread exit never disowns a PI mutex — leaves kernel wait queue entry intact (274e/274f). Real kernel state touched but no controlled corruption demonstrated. Needs deeper exploitation strategy.

## Userland Entry

The exploit chain uses **Hamidashi Creative** (a Japanese visual novel on the Artemis/Lua engine) as the entry point. A modified save file embeds the Lua loader, which starts a TCP listener on port 9026.

> Red = critical step (Account ID must match or PS5 rejects the save)

- **Game:** Hamidashi Creative - free demo on Japanese PSN
- **Loader:** Based on [shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader)
- **Kernel offsets:** From [@hammer-83](https://github.com/hammer-83)'s [ps5-jar-loader](https://github.com/hammer-83/ps5-jar-loader) (fw 1.00-10.01 only; 14.10 offsets TBD)
- **Entry method:** Save file exploit via PS4 backwards compatibility

See [docs/USERLAND_ENTRY.md](docs/USERLAND_ENTRY.md) for the full setup guide.

## Use AI to Help

All research data is in this repo so anyone can feed it to their AI model of choice.

**For maximum-context models (1M+ tokens):**
- Feed `docs/ALL_RESULTS.md` + `docs/ALL_PROBES.md` + `CLAUDE.md` for the entire research corpus
- Ask the model to find novel KASLR defeat paths that haven't been tried
- Ask it to cross-reference 13.60 kernel dumps against 14.10 behavior

**For smaller context models:**
1. Start with `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for the full picture
2. Feed `docs/STRATEGY.md` for what's been tried and what's next
3. Feed `docs/FINDINGS.md` for all technical findings
4. Point it at specific probe results in `results/` for raw data analysis

**What we need help with most:**
- **KASLR defeat** - 17 techniques tested, all dead. Need a novel information leak path.
- **13.60 to 14.10 kernel diff analysis** - the companion repo has 13.60 kernel dumps. What changed?
- **FreeBSD r230171 source analysis** - find exploitable code paths reachable from our ~40 working syscalls
- **WebKit/JSC crash analysis** - run the 518-case corpus, analyze any crashes
- **Device driver reverse engineering** - Sony NID command codes for the 34 open /dev nodes

## Related Research

### V13.60 Kernel Research
The companion [PS5 V13.60 Research](https://github.com/ZigZagBoi1/PS5-V13.60-Research) repository maintains the firmware 13.60 Relapse and Byepervisor-Reborn research. Relapse's 13.60 support does not imply support on 14.10 (AF_ROUTE KASLR is confirmed dead here).

### WebKit Research (pastawithpesto)
[pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research](https://github.com/pastawithpesto/PS5-14.10-Jailbreak-Research) covers the browser side of the same 14.10 chain:
- Their Stages 1-2: WebKit corruption -> arbitrary R/W
- This repo: userland/kernel side (Lua loader, syscall surface, kernel exploitation)
- MetadataTable overflow (CVE-2026-64784) confirmed on two 14.10 consoles
- CSSFontFace UAF (CVE-2026-43715) device test deployed
- Their Stage 3/4 kernel candidates validated against our [ATTACK_SURFACE.md](docs/ATTACK_SURFACE.md)

## Key Constraints

- **W^X enforced** - `mmap(RWX)` gives RW only; `mprotect(EXEC)` always fails
- **Execute-only memory (XOM)** - system lib .text is XO (reading crashes); eboot is RX
- **Limited threading** - `fork`, `rfork` blocked; `thr_create(430)` and `thr_new(455)` both work
- **Per-connection ASLR** - fresh process per TCP connection, all addresses must be re-derived
- **SMAP enforced** - no timing differentiation between mapped/unmapped kernel VA
- **No kernel pointers found** - extensive scanning across every accessible interface
- **/dev/dmem0** - GPU aperture only, cannot access CPU/kernel physical memory
- **Port binding restricted** - bind() returns -1 for ports >= 40000, use 1024-32767

## Why This Is Open Source

By publishing every probe, every finding, and every commit publicly, this project is permanently disqualified from Sony's PlayStation Bug Bounty Program. That's a deliberate choice.

This research is for the community. When a kernel primitive is found, it won't be sold, it won't be held back, and it won't be gatekept. It'll be published here, for free, for anyone to use.

Everything here has been funded out of pocket. Donations help offset that cost, but they're never mandatory. This is a research project, not a product. It takes as long as it takes.

**Contributors welcome.** Whether you have the hardware or just want to analyze FreeBSD kernel code, there's work to do. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
