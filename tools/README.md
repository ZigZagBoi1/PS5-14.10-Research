# Tools

Utilities for sending probes to the PS5, reviewing saved output, and running network-side attack sessions.

## audit_research.py

Read-only, standard-library inventory and curated evidence checks (Python 3.10+):

```bash
python tools/audit_research.py
python tools/audit_research.py --output ../offline-audit.md
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Checks each expanded experiment ID against exact names or explicit terminal-`*`
prefixes, reports ambiguous membership without assigning coverage, and verifies
the ledger's evidence hashes/anchors. Inventory notices do not imply integrity
failure or scientific verdicts. No console contact or Lua evaluation. See the
[ledger guide](../docs/RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.md) for matching rules, exit codes,
provenance limits and how this complements the existing upstream audits.

## send_probe.py / send_probe.ps1

Sends one Lua probe script to the PS5 loader over TCP. The sender never retries
automatically. The Python sender supports `--timeout` as an idle read timeout
and `--total-timeout` as an optional wall-clock cap. `--save` mirrors probe
subdirectories below this checkout's `probes/` directory into `results/`.
Use `--metadata` with the Python sender to add a JSON sidecar containing the
transport status, elapsed time, probe hash, and target address; it also records
silent/reset runs as empty captures.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/send_probe.py --save --metadata --strict \
    probes/<phase>/<probe_name>.lua
```

Native PowerShell alternative:

```powershell
.\tools\send_probe.ps1 probes\<phase>\<probe_name>.lua -Save
```

The loader expects an 8-byte little-endian uint64 length prefix followed by raw
Lua source on TCP port 9026. Results are relative to the current working
directory. A timeout/reset is a transport outcome only; correlate it with
`tools/ps5_watchdog.py` before calling it a process kill or console reboot.

## run_probe_batch.py

Runs a bounded list sequentially. It stops at the first timeout, reset, refusal,
or silent close unless `--continue-on-failure` is explicitly supplied. It does
not relaunch the game or retry a probe, and `--save` writes a batch JSON
manifest.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/run_probe_batch.py --save --strict \
    probes/phase14_final_push/54o_cfunc_redirect_controlled.lua \
    probes/phase14_final_push/54p_redirect_minimal.lua
```

For the current redirect probes, run only after the game and loader have been
restarted. Keep `--continue-on-failure` off so a wedged session cannot cause a
second probe to be sent automatically.

## analyze_result.py

Reviews saved probe output locally, without connecting to a console:

```bash
python tools/analyze_result.py "results/*.txt"
```

Marked pointer lines use the same 64-bit value scan and address classifier as
ordinary data output. A buffer offset such as `kinfo+0x060` is not the pointer
value that follows it. Probe-reported marker alerts remain visible, including
summaries that print values on separate lines; those alerts are distinct from
parsed address candidates.

The report remains heuristic: a candidate or probe alert is not proof of a leak,
and the kernel-base/sysent estimates are not verified firmware 14.10 addresses.

## deep_result_scanner.py

Walks every `results/**/*.txt` capture and rewrites
`evidence/deep_result_scan.md` in place:

```bash
python tools/deep_result_scanner.py
```

Kernel-pointer and deobfuscated-pointer candidates require the same
data-output gate as `analyze_result.py`: hexdump rows, buffer views,
return values, or probe markers. Timing rows, verify echoes, and
arithmetic labels are excluded because they echo the probe's own inputs.
Other buckets, the report layout, and the entrypoint are unchanged.

## handler_claim_audit.py

Re-checks the tier-1 claims in `docs/VERIFIED_HANDLER_ANALYSIS.md` against the
committed 13.60 artifacts, offline:

```bash
python tools/handler_claim_audit.py
python tools/handler_claim_audit.py --check   # exit 1 if any claim drifts
```

The audit needs `docs/dumps_13.60/` (sysent index, `handler_*.bin`,
`kernel_text.bin`) and `results/kernel_handlers/asm/`; it reports which checks
were skipped when they are absent. Findings are written up in
[../docs/HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md](../docs/HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md).

Three facts the audit establishes, all easy to get wrong by eye:

- `handler_NNN.bin` are 8-byte trampoline tables (512 `E9 rel32` slots), not
  handler bodies. Offsets quoted in the analysis are handler-relative, and the
  three claim-2 offsets resolve to one shared site.
- Handler-relative offsets are only as good as the base they are added to. The
  claim-1 offsets are correct relative to syscall 593's entry and still land
  inside syscall 608's body, because the padding between handlers is `nop`
  rather than `int3` and a linear disassembly crosses the seam silently. The
  audit resolves every thunk to its body and uses the next body start as the
  upper bound.
- The `sys_662` count guard `lea eax,[r15-0x81]; cmp eax,0xffffff7f; ja 0x3afa33`
  is an *upper* bound of 128: the `ja` target is the buffer-setup path and the
  fall-through sets `r15d = 0x16` (EINVAL), so exactly `1..0x80` is admitted and
  `0x40000001` is rejected before the allocation. Getting this direction
  backwards manufactures a stack clash out of a bounded copy, so
  `count_accepted()` is a named, unit-tested function rather than an inline
  expression — and the tests assert against the branch targets, not against
  the function's own prose.

These are static observations over an unverified acquisition. No console is
contacted and no firmware 14.10 claim is made.

## gen_syscall_labels.py

Regenerates the `SYSCALL_NAMES` table inside `tools/ghidra_label_syscalls.py`
from the committed 13.60 capture:

```bash
python tools/gen_syscall_labels.py          # rewrite the marked block
python tools/gen_syscall_labels.py --check  # exit 1 if the block is stale
```

The table must not be hand-edited. It is derived from
`docs/sysent-names-13.60.csv` (735 native entries) and covers every named slot
below 532; the Ghidra script labels 532-676 as `sony_syscall_N` itself. The
previous hand list was a compacted FreeBSD-9 sequence that dropped
unimplemented slots without renumbering, which shifted entries by up to sixteen
numbers. See
[../docs/SYSCALL_LABEL_CORRECTION.md](../docs/SYSCALL_LABEL_CORRECTION.md).

## Regression tests

Run the hardware-free sender and analyzer regression suites:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py" -v
```

Sender tests exercise the actual Python and available PowerShell CLIs against a
local TCP loader; PowerShell cases are skipped when neither `powershell.exe`
nor `pwsh` is installed. Analyzer tests use temporary synthetic captures and
check the reported pointer values, counts, and false-positive cases. Neither
suite contacts a console. `test_evidence_pins.py` pins cited probe lines,
capture lines, sysent slots, body RVAs, and handler head bytes behind the
kevent and 430 evidence notes; a stale citation fails by name.

`tier2_claim_audit.py` (with `test_tier2_claim_audit.py`) re-checks TIER 2
claims 9-15 of `docs/VERIFIED_HANDLER_ANALYSIS.md` against the committed 13.60
dump: it resolves each syscall's body through `sysent_index.json`, disassembles
it, and reports CONFIRMED / PARTIAL / REFUTED / UNRESOLVED with the decisive
RVA. `--check` exits 1 on drift. It complements `handler_claim_audit.py`, which
covers TIER 1 claims 1-3.

`test_probe58e.py` does both jobs for the thr_create(430) work: it re-derives
every 13.60 address cited by `docs/THR_CREATE_430_CONTEXT.md` from
`docs/dumps_13.60/kernel_text.bin` (trampolines, body heads, branch targets,
the CFI bound, the context-field compares), then executes
`probes/phase15_native_sysent/58e_thr_create_ucontext.lua` under a stub loader
in Lua 5.1 and asserts the exact syscall number, argument shapes, context-field
writes and id-oracle readbacks.

`tier3_claim_audit.py` (with `test_tier3_claim_audit.py`) closes the same table
for TIER 3 claims 16-22: it parses `sysent_raw.bin` for the audit-event and flag
fields, reads the three Sony extension values out of `ucred.bin`, scans the
dynlib handler for the cited module offsets, locates the cited strings in
`kernel_data.bin`, and pins the sys 640 stub. Claims 17 and 20 are reported as
unresolved because no artifact names the functions or thresholds they discuss.

## check_lua_syntax.py

Compiles every `probes/**/*.lua` source with Lupa's Lua 5.1 `loadstring`
without executing it. The reader strips a UTF-8 BOM before compiling, and the
CI `lua-syntax` job installs `lupa==2.6` and runs the checker. A probe that
needs Lua 5.2 syntax such as `goto`, or that still contains a template marker,
fails the job:

```bash
python -m pip install lupa==2.6
python tools/check_lua_syntax.py
```

## run_session40.py

PC-side raw-packet server for the TCP connect-back fuzz (probe 40). Impersonates a fake LAN host so the Windows stack doesn't RST the connection.

```bash
python tools/run_session40.py --ps5-ip 10.0.0.96 --fake-ip 10.0.0.250
```

Runs an ARP responder + raw packet sender from an unowned IP address. The PS5 connects back to the fake IP, then the script delivers malformed TCP segments through the established connection.

## tcp_fuzz_server.py

Standalone TCP fuzzing server for crafting and sending malformed TCP segments to the PS5.

## test_probe46a.lua / test_probe56l.lua / test_probe57e.lua

Lua 5.1 regression harnesses for probe 46a's buffer-modification detector,
probe 56l's corrected-MIB/ktimer logic, and probe 57e's hardened kldsym calls:

```bash
lua tools/test_probe46a.lua
lua tools/test_probe56l.lua
lua tools/test_probe57e.lua
```

Run from the repository root with a Lua 5.1 interpreter. With Python and Lupa's Lua 5.1 runtime installed, the equivalent commands are:

```bash
python -c "from lupa.lua51 import LuaRuntime; LuaRuntime().globals().dofile('tools/test_probe46a.lua')"
python -c "from lupa.lua51 import LuaRuntime; LuaRuntime().globals().dofile('tools/test_probe56l.lua')"
python -c "from lupa.lua51 import LuaRuntime; LuaRuntime().globals().dofile('tools/test_probe57e.lua')"
```

The 46a harness executes the actual probe in isolated memory/syscall sandboxes, checking unchanged zero/sentinel buffers, injected writes, and checked-range boundaries. The 56l harness scripts three handlers (upstream-shaped, all-refused, all-empty) against the unmodified probe, asserting MIB bytes, call shapes, record parsing, and ktimer verdict text. The 57e harness scripts lookup-succeeds, errno-refusal, sentinel-rejection, pcall-failure, and unverified-string handlers against the unmodified probe, asserting echo rows, verdict text, and summary counts. All harnesses never connect to a console and do not validate kernel behavior. See [the 14.10 evidence correction](../docs/SYSCALL_557_14_10_EVIDENCE.md), [the corrected-MIB note](../docs/CORRECTED_MIB_14_10_EVIDENCE.md), and [the kldsym note](../docs/KLDSYM_14_10_EVIDENCE.md).

## `syscall_isolation_sweep.py`

Sweeps a syscall-number range with one TCP connection per number, so a lethal
entry cannot blind the rest of the range. Each generated probe prints a
sentinel line before the call, wraps `make_syscall(N)` (six zero args) in
`pcall`, and prints a result line; the driver classifies each number as
`RETURNED`, `RAISED`, `KILLED_IN_CALL`, `NO_OUTPUT` or `CONNECT_FAILED`
(which aborts the sweep). `--repeat` re-runs each number; `--save` writes the
table and JSON under `results/phase15_native_sysent/`. See
`docs/AIO_RANGE_14_10_EVIDENCE.md` for the measurement gap that motivated it.

`--save` writes the record after every number, not only at the end, so a console
that freezes mid-range still leaves the measurements taken before it on disk. A
freeze also takes the driver with it, which is how the 462-537 window first
produced nothing at all.

`--wait-for-loader SECONDS` waits out a process that died and resumes the same
range once the game has restarted the loader (it comes back on its own in 4-9 s,
sometimes slower). `--skip 430` leaves out slots that are known to take more than
the process with them - 430 `thr_create` panics the kernel on a zeroed context.
The wedge guard (on by default, `--no-wedge-guard` disables it) retries a number
that answers nothing and aborts if it answers nothing again: a call that parks
the Lua thread in the kernel leaves the socket accepting while every later probe
times out. `--resume` drops every number that already has a record under
`results/`, so an interrupted range can be restarted where it stopped rather
than from the top.

## `bounds_fuzz.py`

Fuzzes the declared buffer size of the present Sony handlers instead of their
return value. One connection per `(number, layout, size)` triple, because a
handler that faults takes the loader with it. The generated probe allocates
0x6000 bytes, canvases them, hands the handler a pointer 0x2000 inside, and after
the call counts the dwords that changed inside the size it was given and outside
it, and checks every changed dword against the next one for a qword shaped like
`0xFFFF8xxx_xxxxxxxx`. A written kernel address is `KERNEL-POINTER` (a copyout
that returned kernel memory), a write outside the declared size is `OVERFLOW`,
and a write when the size was zero is `WROTE_AT_ZERO_SIZE`. The report lists the
first four changed dwords (`sample=offset:value`) so a hit can be inspected
without re-running the probe. Layouts put the buffer and the size in different
argument positions (`--layouts`), and `--a1` sets the first argument.

```bash
python tools/bounds_fuzz.py --ps5-ip 192.168.1.121 --range 574-660 \
    --layouts a1_buf_size --sizes 0,0x100 --save
```

Every record is appended to `results/phase17_new_vectors/bounds_fuzz_<stamp>.jsonl`
as it lands, so a crash, a closed laptop or a console power cycle costs one probe
instead of the run. `--resume` reads the newest journal (or the one named by
`--journal`) and skips the triples already in it, so the same command can be
restarted days later and continues where it stopped. A half-written last line
from a hard kill is ignored.

**Risk:** a size above 0x10000 asks the kernel to copy far more than the probe
allocated. If the handler trusts it, the copy crosses into unmapped memory and
the console panics, which needs a physical power cycle rather than the usual
relaunch. The default size list stays below that, and going higher prints a
warning and is an explicit flag.

## `restart_pressure.py`

Measures what a killed loader leaves behind. Every kill costs one loader process,
and the game needs longer and longer to bring it back as the kills accumulate on
one boot: nine seconds at first, then tens of seconds, and eventually the port
stops accepting until the console is power cycled (`docs/SYSCALL_ABSENT_VS_LETHAL.md`).

Each round runs `probes/phase17_new_vectors/217a_restart_pressure.lua`, which prints
one `SAMPLE` line of the counters a fresh process starts with (624 VM operation
counter, 593 module count, 674 VM region count, 671 resource classes), kills the
loader with syscall 4095, times the recovery until the Lua thread answers again,
and samples once more. A counter that climbs across restarts is system-wide and
becomes a readout of console state that does not need the game; a counter that
resets means the accumulation is only visible in the clock.

```bash
python tools/restart_pressure.py --ps5-ip 192.168.1.121 --rounds 6 --save
```

Each round is one kill, so `--rounds` stays small on purpose, and the run stops
early (with the last recovery time recorded) once the loader fails to come back
inside `--wait` seconds.
